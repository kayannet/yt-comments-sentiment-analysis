MrBeast Gaming,"I love all the different ways they fought.<br><br>Karl&#39;s team held them off from his base giving them the home turf advantage and pushed out when they were getting overrun. He also gave much needed motivation and encouragement. <br><br>Chris&#39; team had the aerial advancement bombarding his foes from above and divebombing them when they were out of bombardments. He was very tactical. <br><br>Chandler&#39;s nation were like bloodthirsty barbarians, just rushing their foes head on, going full on aggressive. <br><br>It was so cool to see and made the video so entertaining.",2022-08-28T23:05:22Z

MrBeast Gaming,I was rooting for Karl’s team the entire time because during prep time Karl was communicating and working with his team making a huge base and giving them the right weapons they asked for .

MrBeast Gaming,"I can honestly see three Generals in each of them.<br><br>Chandler&#39;s strategy felt like something from Napoleon Bonaparte, who commanded loyalty and respect. When Napoleon attacked, he split his opponents in two and took them on separately without one of them knowing what happened. Chandler tried to do the same thing but got overwhelmed because of too much chaos and too little organization, just like Napoleon.<br><br>Chris&#39;s strategy felt like something from Obi-Wan Kenobi, he directly attacked Chandler and went above Karl knowing he was on the defensive. Chris always tried to take the high ground immediately, but was ultimately bested by Karl because he underestimated him. Something Obi-Wan wouldn&#39;t have done.<br><br>Karl&#39;s strategy was most likely inspired by Sun Tzu, he stayed on the defense letting the others attack each other, and when the other two teams were out, finished off the rest via a surprise attack and ultimately won the iTunes gift cards.",2022-12-08T03:56:45Z

Markiplier,"Mark, you are probably one of the best people on Youtube. Not in terms of best content, although you are fairly high up that list too, but in general. You raise money for charity, you listen to your fans, you aren&#39;t letting any of this go to your head, and you are one of the most down to earth and humble people I&#39;ve ever seen. Other famous youtubers call their fans &quot;armies&quot; or &quot;followers&quot;, you are on of the few that call us &quot;friends&quot; and actually mean it.

Markiplier,"The goal is to make as less noise as possible, when the pipes break stay still, the pipes attract Mr. Mole and so does walking and messing with that one door",2014-04-12T03:22:37Z

Markiplier,"My Tips For Vanish:<br>1) Do NOT follow the yellow arrows.<br>2) Read the notes.<br>3) Tunnels are SAFE.<br>4) Ask a friend to tell you which way to go or do, &quot;eenie meenie minie moe&quot;<br>5) When you see a dot on the wall with a box around it, STOP IMMEDIATLY and rethink what you are doing completely. <br>6) Scream as much as possible.<br>7) DON&#39;T  believe Phil, he is the moleman.<br>8) DON&#39;T use the glowsticks around notes. They are bad luck…<br>9) If you see a yellow arrow, read tip # 1!<br><br>Hope these tips help you in Vanish!",2014-07-10T06:33:15Z
Markiplier,I understand the name of the game now. Both your hope and sanity VANISH the longer you play it.,2014-06-01T03:32:55Z
Markiplier,"&quot;So I&#39;m going to play it to completion...even if it kills me...which it might...&quot; Oh poor past Mark, you didn&#39;t even know",2015-08-25T15:09:28Z
Markiplier,"I think with this game it&#39;s the random map and well-distributed jumpscares and monsters that give you a sense of hopelessness, because many games have one path that&#39;s distinctly different whereas in this one, they all feel wrong.",2013-12-26T06:19:50Z
Markiplier,"I would have to say that the scariest part of this game is it&#39;s lack of direction. If you think of some of the scariest games Mark has played- Slender, Dreadhalls, Vanish, Dungeon Nightmares, Neverending Nightmares: One of the largest correlations is an open-map style game with a &#39;survive the night&#39; or &#39;get out of here&#39; or even don&#39;t have an objective for a large portion of the game. A lot of these games are randomly generated as well. The dynamic style and addition of literal choice forces the player to take responsibility for their choices.<br><br>For instance, I don&#39;t get scared in horror films or many other liner horror games because tell myself &quot;This is what I have to do, no matter what I can&#39;t change what is happening all I have to do it complete the objective.&quot; whether that be killing zombies, moving through the maze or closing doors to stop animatronics from getting in. But with these games, it&#39;s just about pushing through. You could have no idea how far you are to the end or if you are walking directly to your doom.<br><br>But that&#39;s just my opinion.",2015-02-02T12:44:34Z
Markiplier,Yep. That&#39;s it. The game changes when you play it. That&#39;s terrifying. Nope. Nopenopenopenopenopenope,2013-12-04T01:32:59Z
Markiplier,"This game really exposes the fear of the unknown, the fear that at any point something may happen that is either scary or not scary. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous how our brains rely so much on being able to know something that if we don&#39;t, it actually scares us.",2016-05-29T20:53:29Z
Markiplier,"Man, it warms my heart to hear the old outro.",2015-12-09T05:31:45Z
Markiplier,"Markiplier is 100% right about the fear coming from immersion. Watching this, I don&#39;t find the monsters one bit scary, but the setting is. Walking around and hearing things, but not seeing them. A big thing in making horror films is that the thing you can&#39;t see can be scarier than anything you would actually show.<br><br>I am with him on the death at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPzEEJpeqg&amp;t=15m28s"">15:28</a> not being fair.

Markiplier,In the words of Dan Howell &quot; it appears I&#39;ve just shat myself at an alarming velocity&quot;,2015-10-04T16:28:57Z

Markiplier,This game has been labeled the Nope Game.,2013-12-14T23:50:47Z

Markiplier,"I love these types of small scale horror games. Apocalyptic scenarios simply don&#39;t affect me as strongly. Something about the knowledge that the suffering you are going through is unique. No one knows what is going on to you, but <b>you</b> do.",2019-09-03T04:05:44Z
Markiplier,All these years later and this game still immediately sends my heart skyrocketing,2018-12-23T21:14:00Z
Markiplier,You know Mark is really scared when:<br>1. He doesn&#39;t know what to say/he&#39;s silent <br>2. He talks a lot about the same topic/he laughs much<br><br>By the way: poor babyplier ♥️,2021-07-06T23:58:47Z

Markiplier,I love how Mark always has a terrified look on his face throughout the game,2013-08-07T21:46:20Z
Markiplier,I love his facial expressions!!!,2014-03-01T03:31:36Z
Markiplier,"I&#39;m going full screen, you guys... wish me luck. (This is legitimately my first time watching the series)",2016-02-02T17:45:19Z

Markiplier,I have to watch this again. This series was priceless haha.,2016-04-09T22:42:45Z
Markiplier,A horror game that lets you hide from monsters rather than just running around randomly? Faith in humanity restored.,2014-07-04T20:28:27Z
Markiplier,"A map that changes on you, creepy monsters lurking everywhere, and some pretty entertaining notes. Mark&#39;s screams add the finishing touch for a great video",2013-08-23T05:45:04Z

Markiplier,"10 months later, it’s kinda amazed me how mark’s “cannon” in his channel has gone from him, a silly goof character, and an edgy anti persona to a story about a bunch of broken people. Wilford snapped, Damien is a creature of vengeance, and Mark is someone who can’t fail himself so he sees himself as perfect and the center.",2020-03-23T15:01:42Z

Markiplier,"I have a theory (well, more of a headcanon but we’ll go with it) that connects the events of WKM with Heist, Date, and eventually Heist 2:<br><br>After betraying all of his friends and losing everything he has, Actor Mark is trying to find a new way of life. He wants to have fun, but he needs a companion. All of the people he knew, he hates, except for one - us. Also referred to as “Y/N”, “the audience”, “the viewer”, or “the district attorney”, we are the only person that Mark doesn’t have a personal vendetta against. So what does he do? He uses the knowledge he obtained from experimenting with the house to free us from our place in front of the mirror.<br><br>With a companion, he now needs something to do. A way to have fun while still boosting his ever-increasing ego. So what does he do? He goes on riveting adventures with his new “friend”. We meet interesting people, break out of jails, get deserted on islands, try to survive the zombie apocalypse, meet aliens, and so on. But there’s still an issue; we know what Mark did.<br><br>So in order to gain our trust, Mark pretends to be likable. He takes us to dinner, falls down a pit so we can save ourselves, cares for us when we get hurt, and even takes a laser to the chest when the scientist thinks we’re an anomaly. But it’s all a facade. We cannot be harmed in this world, and if we die, everything resets to a fixed point where we can try it all again. He even pretends to give us (very limited) “choices”, so it feels like we’re more free than we are. However, we can see his true self come through a few times, for example with the “Meta ending” in Date, or when he acts like a misogynist saying that he wants to go to the military base because there is a “trusting man”.<br><br>In these intertwining stories, Mark is the hero of all of it. But, just like the Actor said, every good hero needs a villain. That’s where Darkiplier comes in. Whenever we meet, he is trying to tell us that what is happening is all just a game, and that we’re living in Mark’s made-up world. But Mark always tries to stop Dark in order to hide us from the truth. Think about it, has Dark ever tried to hurt us? He may seem evil because of his temper and composure, but are his motivations due to genuine malice, or just hatred towards Mark and a need to protect the viewer?<br><br>But Dark isn’t the only person who found his way into Mark’s stories. Wilford is also a character who interacts with the viewer. But unlike Dark, he’s here for the fun of it. He enjoys Mark’s new take on life, and secretly wants to spend time with the viewer to make up for his mistakes in the past.<br><br>This theory explains:<br>-Why Y/N is no longer stuck in front of the mirror<br>-Why Mark from Date/Heist seems nicer than the Actor<br>-Why Darkiplier is portrayed as a villain<br>-Why we see Warfstache in the choose-your-own-adventures<br>-What Mark did after the events of Damien<br>-How WKM links to Mark’s other projects<br><br>TL;DR- Actor Mark saves us from the mirror so he can have a companion to go on adventures (Date/Heist) with. He pretends to be nicer as to gain our trust. He portrays Dark as the villain to 1.Make himself seem more heroic, and 2.Make us think that everything Dark says is a lie in order to manipulate us.<br><br>It’s a little choppy, but I just felt like it was a nice way to link Mark’s dramatic projects with his more cheery ones.",2021-03-29T18:48:51Z

Markiplier,"As a published author nigh-constantly studying the concepts of storytelling, I thought I&#39;d share some thoughts about Mark&#39;s writing style:<br><br>Mark&#39;s writing isn&#39;t perfect. A few interactions could be smoother, some characters fleshed out, and some odd conveniences explained (such as the gardener in Who Killed Markiplier.) That said, he has two things that really set him apart from other storytellers. His methods and his moments. Let me explain. <br>I have never encountered a plot as bizarre as the Who Killed Markiplier series. This strange, disjointed style that relies on intrigue and confusion to keep its audience engaged... it&#39;s all wonderfully refreshing. By itself a good video method does not make, however. This is where Mark&#39;s moments come in. He knows how to toy with tension, and how to build to a powerful point. When the music swells, the world softens, and a few lines are skillfully delivered. This is so well done that even in confusion the audience still senses importance. Each video delivers emotion despite not providing any straight answers, and I can honestly say that is <i>no easy feat!</i><br><br>Will it pay off? We&#39;ll have to wait and see. Intrigue only sustains for so long, and if Mark can&#39;t answer every question he&#39;s created satisfactorily, he&#39;ll end up collapsing everything in on itself. We saw something similar happen to the TV show, Lost.",2019-05-28T07:27:41Z
Markiplier,"I get a really Handsome Jack vibe from The Actor, and I love it.<br>Also, my impression from the ending was that Seline had been Dark by herself, and the ending was Damien basically beginning to co-pilot Dark with her, that, rather than taking turns, they&#39;d be permanently together as Dark, both permanentloy changed. I missed the scene of her asleep in the water.",2020-03-28T15:44:52Z

Please excuse the long comment.<br><br>Mark asks &quot;who is the opposite of me?&quot; He mentioned before that Dark was the opposite of him, but in what way? Narcissistic, manipulative, and selfish. We&#39;ve seen Damien, and we know he is not those things. Celine is cutthroat, possibly manipulative, but for what reason? To protect Damien. Was it good? The best idea or method? Most likely, no. But she thinks about someone other than herself.<br><br>Consider the actor. So wrapped up in himself, so self-absorbed, that he can&#39;t possibly imagine being wrong. Being &quot;the bad guy.&quot; Everything is someone else&#39;s fault. He is incredibly selfish, only thinking of his own wants and desires. The actor is the true opposite of the Mark we know.<br><br>Actor says he needs a villain and that Damien will be perfect for the role. Damien remarks to Celine, rather sarcastically, that Actor should be careful what he wishes for. So, given the choice, what does he do? He becomes the Actor&#39;s villain.<br><br>&quot;The true villain is the man with the most enemies.&quot; Actor made an enemy of Damien and Celine. What better villain could Damien immitate than the one who stole everything from him?<br><br>&quot;Darkiplier&quot; is a character. A facade. A role.

Markiplier,"I personally enjoy the Happy Wheels Highlights. It&#39;s one of my favorite things on Markiplier&#39;s channel. It may seem repetitive to some, but the different ways that normal people like us make these interesting puzzles, tracks, &amp; other things make them more unique in their own way. It&#39;s like a bunch of mini-games being put together, like some of the Pokemon things like the contests in Hoenn, PokeAthelon &amp; bug contests in Johto, &amp; the Pokemon dress up in Unova.",2014-06-09T20:35:04Z

Markiplier,"I honestly can&#39;t get enough of those. Happy Wheels is repetitive like hell, but you just need to get to know how to entertain people while playing it. Good job, Mark :-) Keep it up! Cheers <b>from Poland</b> :-)",2014-06-09T16:58:45Z
Markiplier,You can tell he recorded this after the impossible game. Not as cheery as he usually is....was......,2014-06-09T20:00:28Z

jacksepticeye,If you wanted the game on PC from the get go you were always going to have to wait cos that&#39;s how R* have always released GTA games. The game is still going to sell tonnes on PC regardless due to people wanting a superior version that runs and looks better. Also with the ability to mod later on,2013-10-09T22:02:39Z

jacksepticeye,"Each of these games has an absolutely fantastic blend of atmospheric/psychological and shock horror. It&#39;s seriously a refreshing scene.<br>I also really liked the premise of the first game. It sort of, but I couldn&#39;t say why, reminded me of an H.P Lovecraft short. The story was essentially that this abominable monster lived in a dark cellar all of his life and had never seen the sun, the grass, or other people, and he spent most of his time reading. I forget how he learned to read but it was something like a caretaker. One day he finds a way to escape and he finally sees the moon, right? Eventually he manages to find a house and a mirror in the light and he finds out why everyone was scared of him: he is a monster and he never knew it. I don&#39;t know why but the first and second game really gave me a similar vibe to what I had when I read that story.",2020-06-01T11:43:30Z

jacksepticeye,I&#39;m kinda glad Seán also gets a weird panicky and breathless feeling when watching/hearing those &quot;just the breath&quot; videos. I thought I was crazy for having an extreme physical dislike for them,2023-03-21T13:30:24Z

jacksepticeye,I think this was the best Meme Time episode. The longer ones were especially impressive and it shows how much Sean cares that he saw the four minute time stamp and just decided it was four minutes of his day to spend appreciating fans and their efforts. So many people who just have regular lives click off when they find out something is more than a minute long because we have short attention spans or can&#39;t be bothered to dedicate ourselves to one thing for too long.,2023-05-02T14:35:25Z

The first just felt like a typical &quot;possessed baby&quot; story with mild Lovecraftian elements to it, <i>especially</i> with the whole head spinning around thing on the original night 3, whereas the storybook update leans <i>much</i> more heavily into the esoteric King in Yellow theme they were going for. Honestly really glad I got to play the update first, it scratches that Lovecraft itch for me. (BTW, there 6 more souls to save in the updated Escape route, if you wanna get some more secrets to play with. Although I think that&#39;s <i>another</i> update on top of the one that changed the house and added storybooks, since it still says 6/6 at the end there.)",2022-06-11T08:02:53Z

The apartment has also received a makeover so the interior looks more like a house instead of an apartment. Reminder for newbies: Make sure you collect all 6 trapped souls in the demon baby&#39;s apartment BEFORE you try to find the 6 new trapped souls on the Escape AKA the &quot;White Rabbit&quot; route! The events of the original 3 nights have also changed enough so that they&#39;re worth replaying again even if you&#39;ve already seen how the 3 nights played out beforehand! I also highly recommend that people try flushing the demon baby down the toilet. It&#39;s tricky to place him on it after putting the lid up, but it can be done! 😉",2022-06-21T02:12:15Z

jacksepticeye,"Jackie if you want to have a break more often, it is perfectly okay, always do what you feel like to :D",2016-06-14T18:03:57Z

jacksepticeye,Glad the results came back saying you are ok was litrelly so releaved :D And you really deserve a break man i really dont know how you do it I was thinking about it becuase I upload a really heavily editied video once every 2 days and from recording to editing to uploading put together it takes just shy of a day as in around 23 hours (My interent is so bad thats part of it aswell) And I am always putting everything I can into my vids and people dont realise how much of like a push that is! Becuase yo are a normal guy like everone else but despite whatever cold your personal problems and whatever you are doing that day not only do you upload 2 videos but you upload 2 well editied cut down super energetic videos and that takes allot! So congrats on your results and all the best you are amazing man!,2014-10-13T19:10:15Z

DanTDM,"I am super sorry for your huge loss, the games narrator called you seven underscores. Very unfortunate, I have a friend who played that game, they got called seven underscores and never spoke to me again, their mom told me that had to go to mental therapy about seven underscores. I talk to them now but when I mention anything about underscores, they have a mental breakdown and go through in game cutscene dialog but you can&#39;t skip it. Whenever I say, &quot;that&#39;s nasty and crusty dusty slayyyy!&quot; They simply go offline and not talk to me for 2 more years. I gave away my dog once, he watched his new owner play an online game, he called his dog seven underscores online, I had to re-adopt him and take him to a mental therapist and the ER, seventeen years of mental therapy and keep drinking water after being called such a thing, good to go! Hope this helps!<br><br>Edit: idk why I wrote an essay about 7 underscores, ima rewrite it<br><br>Dantdm, my favorite youtuber, got called 7 UNDERSCORES!? I swear I will tear off the games narrators skin! I&#39;m so sorry Dan, I feel everyone&#39;s went through this before. And I feel bad and am super sorry for your loss of braincells! So I write this for vengeance! I once had a friend, we were playing fortnite. His other friend texted him, he called him 7 underscores, I told him he wasn&#39;t a good friend but he went offline, my mom said his mom texted her. Saying he had to go to therapy, his therapist said they were hinting at sending him to an asylum. I felt so bad, he got released and the second I mention anything about underscores he has a mental breakdown, when he tries to explain has a seizure, he died soon after. And once, I had a dog. His name was Roro, and I sold him because he was throwing up on my floor. The shelter called him 7 underscores, and he disintegrated. They put his skeleton in the yard to rot. I feel the best cure is 6 months of therapy,  drinking water constantly with abc soup, and more attention from friends or whoever you have. Hope it helps Dan!<br><br>Love, Pixolotl!",2022-11-25T00:50:56Z

Ninja,I feel like console needs smaller set of options to turn down the graphic settings. So not as detailed as PC settings. I think IF xbox series S was able to turn off a bunch of shit it could get to 120 fps 1440p. Compared to what Ninja&#39;s settings look like and what the new update on series s looks like you can definitely see room for fps optimization,2022-12-13T08:23:47Z

Youtuber,Comments,Date
theRadBrad,Appreciate the support on this series fam! I’ll have longer videos after the next few videos. Thanks for all the love,2020-04-12T18:21:27Z
theRadBrad,The general rule about weaknesses is:<br>Humans - Fire<br>Robots - Thunder<br>Monsters - Ice<br>Flying Stuff - Wind,2020-04-18T14:11:40Z
theRadBrad,"I&#39;ve never got into final fantasy but this remake looks really good.<br><br>Your the best let&#39;s play host, theRadBrad is amazing.",2020-04-12T18:02:39Z
theRadBrad,Can&#39;t get enough of watching this!&lt;3 Pro tip: pair the auto heal materia with the healing materia on tifa to get it to work,2020-04-12T18:44:34Z
theRadBrad,"I&#39;m glad there&#39;s people who are enjoying this remake, I think its a GOTY candidate at least. It&#39;s not perfect but it would be unreasonable to expect that because people will always find something about this game to complain about, and having a carbon copy remake would seriously limit the depth and immersion of this remake so I&#39;m glad they made changes, I&#39;m glad you get Sephiroth in your face early. No mystery behind it just make him terrifying from the word go. <br>Sephiroth as popular of a villain as he&#39;s always been, I&#39;d like him to be a bit more disliked, similar to Kefka from FF4 who&#39;s hated by his own men because he&#39;s such an evil prick. I want to see an evil as hell Sephiroth. So far so good, seriously only a couple hours in and he&#39;s already got Cloud psyched out of his mind, I love it the mindgames already<br>Also if all the characters from the original game are in this remake then eventually Barret won&#39;t be the only character who can do ranged attacks. <br>If weapons and armor have linked materia slots that should mean that there will eventually be &quot;All&quot; Materia and hopefully &quot;Mime&quot;, &quot;Final Attack&quot; and &quot;Quadra&quot; materia hopefully.",2020-04-12T23:21:56Z
theRadBrad,Rad: this is what it&#39;ll do... Run away<br><br>Jonathan/Jotaro/Giorno: we passed on the secret technique,2020-04-12T22:35:43Z

theRadBrad,"(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6pKfFW8dw0&amp;t=15m25s"">15:25</a>) Connection between materia slots will have its own function later on the game. If u played original FF7 on PS1, there are some blue materia that can make green materia target all enemies if u link them both using that connection.",2020-04-15T14:44:41Z

theRadBrad,Waiting until 2AM for a Brad&#39;s upload is so worth 👌🏻,2020-04-12T18:07:10Z

theRadBrad,My friend and I die a thousand times in this part 😂,2016-03-21T06:02:10Z
theRadBrad,"Am I the only one here who thinks this looks amazing?! Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve stayed away from games for soo long but I could never fully comprehend how people highly criticize this game, I think it&#39;s because they prefer the old-style Resident Evil games, fair enough - I humbly agree that they should return back to their scary-claustrophobic gaming roots, but in all honesty, had this game had another solo title other than &quot;Resident Evil&quot; - people would probably deem this an excellent game by all standards, just my opinion.",2014-06-25T19:54:17Z
theRadBrad,"During this part, we can pair each character with different partners. That triggers different dialogues.",2015-04-13T19:20:50Z
theRadBrad,"I loved this part of the game, it was just...awesome, imo...",2014-08-24T02:32:59Z
theRadBrad,"Keep it up Brad, you&#39;re doing great :D",2012-10-25T02:05:19Z
theRadBrad,I remember playin this game and comepleted it alot and it gives me memories. And this level is one of my hardest levels on my list and my fav,2020-07-10T02:00:50Z
theRadBrad,"Hey brad, did you know the dialogue changes based on who you pair up with at the levers?",2012-10-25T14:30:12Z
theRadBrad,Those camera angle and PC control in that scene is the most disturbing thing RE ever pulled off.,2016-03-18T07:56:30Z
theRadBrad,Haos is actually ridiculously easy to kill as a final boss,2013-08-01T02:16:41Z
theRadBrad,When I first heard that line &quot;You better put a leash on that puppy.&quot; I replied &#39;B*tch put a leach on these bullets.&#39; I love this channel. I&#39;ve bought more games off of Brad recommendation them anyone elses.,2012-10-26T09:41:49Z
theRadBrad,"for reals, this is probably one of my favorite momments in the whole game. just the music, setting and boss. i really enjoyed this part, even though i know a lot of people hated the haos chase. yes i died a few times, but they all times felt like it was my fault. what? u wanna play w/ a no death count? play something easy like Zelda. i love the camera angles. cinematic, yet, they show you just enough so you know where ur going. only reasons i died was because of the part where you had to slide, which btw, your AI partner teaches you how as he&#39;s running in front of you. if you still died, well learn to adapt faster idiot. and if you were playing coop, which i was, btw, i had the thought after i died of sliding and so did my buddy when we both failed. the only other reasons we died in this part was because we tried to slide too late or too early. again, our fault. after we nailed that part, we had no problems getting to the rest of them. awwww, i&#39;m sawry if you guys are not used to seeing Game Over screens in an era where a game practically plays itself for you you, but no once did this part feel unfair to me and my friend.",2013-11-08T00:56:45Z
theRadBrad,Brad you can press rb and x to refill your pill case without going into the menues it also combines your herbs for you.,2012-10-25T02:38:37Z
theRadBrad,"Hey brad,
Can&#39;t wait to see the new video commentary. Been an RE fan since RE2. Played it at 11, took me 16 hours to beat it.

For any other RE fans, There is a way to use the Sub-Machine Gun without using bullets as you would. Once you aquire it in the weapons storage room, point it at an enemy once you find it, aim, then rapidly hit it the fire command. You&#39;ll shoot one bullet, but will shake your gun and watch the monsters bleed. If you are curious to try it, go ahead and have a blast.",2012-10-26T17:20:58Z
theRadBrad,fast forward to 2020 i still haven&#39;t passed this part of chris story  i died like  20 times already,2020-04-20T12:44:58Z

theRadBrad,"Basically you have to be side by side with your partner while escaping HAOS. Otherwise, you will not make it all they way through.",2015-04-13T19:23:28Z
theRadBrad,"Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m the only female gamer who plays RPG&#39;s of this caliber. Gotta love the fact that nobody is acknowledging the whole &quot;PILL POPPING ANIMAL&quot; factor they&#39;ve added to RE. I&#39;m really loving your vids, so keep up the good work! :0) ~KB",2012-11-17T17:52:41Z
theRadBrad,This boss was a nightmare to face and look at,2019-10-19T08:24:39Z
theRadBrad,"Haos reminds me of the final boss from Ninja Gaiden 2, when he was in his first form any way... Now if only Chris was jumping and running off walls while slashing shit up with a sword and throwing fireballs everywhere.",2013-01-26T18:52:57Z
theRadBrad,The boss in this one reminds me of the one in resident evil 5 with the giant crab thing.,2013-06-28T06:41:08Z
theRadBrad,bologna sandwhich + fruit mix + brads videos = wonderful saturday. thanks brad,2012-10-27T20:37:18Z

theRadBrad,I literally just can never get passed this level that BOW always catches me.,2016-04-20T23:13:17Z

theRadBrad,I had to do that end part like 10 times 😂😩,2016-02-16T06:21:47Z
theRadBrad,"Usually when i see something good in the boxes i smash, when i play, it tells me either theres a boss up ahead or, that something else like a many boss, for example, is up ahead.",2012-10-31T04:25:33Z
theRadBrad,"I really don&#39;t understand why in some of these comments people want Resident evil to go back to the &quot;Survival horror&quot; style, if you ask me, the only scary game in the franchise was RE4, especially considering the beginning in the village, I never got scared from the older games and even then CAPCOM knew the games had also an action appeal as seen with the battle games and the mercenaries, I&#39;m actually enjoying the stories they are now making, it shows how the threat and characters have evolved from being simple cops and bystanders to the heroes of the stories and how the T-Virus quickly motivated the change for an even bigger menace, be it Uroboros or the C-Virus, the stakes are constantly getting higher and as seen with Chris, it can be quite tragic to lose those around you in a war you didn&#39;t want to be a part of and you&#39;re only there because of one wrong night at the mansion.",2014-06-01T20:55:38Z
theRadBrad,"old school RE fixed angles, so new players know what a pain in the ass it used to be.",2016-07-16T19:53:54Z

theRadBrad,The fight scene between David and Javi was honestly so emotional. Just &quot;I love you brother&quot; gave me the chills,2017-05-30T03:18:28Z
theRadBrad,I noticed that the walkers from season 1 to 3 get skinnier because of lack of food,2017-05-30T13:30:22Z
theRadBrad,The fact that every single Garcia looks at Clem with disgust when she suggests the idea makes me weirdly happy.,2017-05-30T04:28:26Z

theRadBrad,"The reason I think Tripp is still alive is, because if TellTale games wanted to confirm his death they would&#39;ve​ shown his body splatter on the ground or they would&#39;ve shown it. Also because David and Javi jump quickly​ to the conclusion that Tripp is dead without either one checking. It seemed like a weird jump from Tripp falling to his supposed &quot;death&quot; to Javi and David being like &quot;Yea he&#39;s gone, he died fighting.&quot; Those are my reasons ​why I think Tripp is not dead.",2017-05-30T02:19:44Z

theRadBrad,"Brad, best way to avoid severe physical damage doing melee, is to kick them down first then bash their heads out. (helps conserve a lot stamina)",2013-04-25T01:48:07Z
theRadBrad,"Guns and ammo are incredibly rare in Dead Island.  The only reason he appeared to pull out a gun at one moment is because the character he&#39;s playing has that for her &quot;Fury&quot; mode.  Notice that no gun appears in his inventory otherwise, unfortunately.",2013-04-25T20:25:17Z
theRadBrad,"Just a quick reminder, broken melee weapons (0% remaining) cost more than a 50% remaining melee weapon<br>You can&#39;t lose pistols or shotguns but the ammo and they&#39;re hard to find, you can&#39;t buy them either like in Dying Light",2015-04-28T23:22:55Z

theRadBrad,Honestly clicked on the newest upload so I could comment and say thank you for being such a wholesome YouTuber anytime I’d look up a walkthrough of a game I couldn’t get you were always there to play it.

theRadBrad,Keep being that amazing youtuber I love! You’re the best! Thank you for never changing who you are!,2021-07-12T23:23:14Z
theRadBrad,I think Legion of the Dead is a zombie mode that you can play either alone or with up to 4 friends (I imagine you&#39;ll be doing it alone). It&#39;s the same London map and whatnot but I think the red zones will indicate either high zombie density or hostile survivor camps or something.,2021-07-08T17:34:02Z
theRadBrad,I&#39;d love to see more side quest,2021-07-08T16:09:47Z

GameGrumps,"To be fair, I think Barry is a tad off-base when he says all characters function the same. Sure, a lot of forward attacks, up airs, whatever you want to say, are similar in function, but characters themselves are very versatile. Little Mac has the charge meter. Olimar has the pikmin. Characters like Kirby have only their body while characters like Marth have disjointed hitboxes with weapons, making priority attacks very different. Link has a ton of projectiles, someone like kirby has none. Some have up air recoveries, some have multiple or super jumps.<br><br>It&#39;s actually not easy for someone who&#39;s mediocre at the game and only plays one character to pick up another character and do well. Not saying Ross didn&#39;t do well, but the idea that you can easily play any character with one mindset, is wrong.<br><br>Still a great video.

GameGrumps,sure do love Ross&#39;s frustrating incompetence,2016-10-18T21:36:50Z
GameGrumps,Yes! Now I get to watch it twice and I still will have that feeling of watching a new video,2016-10-18T20:02:59Z
GameGrumps,I like this series way too much.,2016-10-19T02:30:45Z
GameGrumps,Apparently Ross develops an Irish accent when he&#39;s angry.,2016-12-21T08:20:41Z
GameGrumps,Can someone please make a &quot;1 Melbourne&quot; 1 loop video or compilation. the longer the video; the more depressed Ross gets. I know it sounds awful but this vid is making laugh so hard.,2016-10-19T17:43:30Z
GameGrumps,"99% of this playthrough is Ross beating the level, then resetting and getting stuck for half hour",2016-10-18T21:09:49Z
GameGrumps,Nice to see the guys from Mega Man pulling through in the end.,2016-10-18T20:04:58Z
GameGrumps,I love the level of challenge in Zelda II; starts off fairly difficult and slowly grows more difficult until this monster of a last level.,2016-12-01T11:40:33Z
GameGrumps,Wouldn&#39;t it be terrible if a flatline sounded like the Final Fantasy victory theme.,2015-02-27T18:04:54Z
GameGrumps,"Hilariously, the &quot;harpies&quot; and the bird-headed knights don&#39;t have known English names, and are known only as &quot;Fokkeru&quot; and &quot;Fokka&quot; respectively.<br><br>Which honestly sounds a lot like what you might shout when one inevitably jumps you.",2015-02-27T19:51:07Z
GameGrumps,"Emotional comment but whatever: it was kinda helpful for Arin to talk about the weirdness of funerals and the addition of flowers and &quot;happy&quot; things during those events, since my sister passed away last week and hearing someone say what I&#39;ve been thinking during a time like this was super wonderful.",2015-02-28T19:03:09Z
GameGrumps,I really really REALLY liked the animation of the Xerox era. I always found them so charming. Especially 101 Dalmatians. I think watching those films when I was a child birthed my love for sketchy artwork and animation. I just love rough sketches. I don&#39;t know what it is about it hahaha,2016-10-28T03:07:19Z
GameGrumps,"I actually like the style of the Disney 60&#39;s - 80&#39;s xerox style.  It&#39;s rough around the edges and you can sometimes see the rough linework before cleanup. To me it adds more character and feeling to a drawing instead of it being so clean that it actually ends up &quot;stiffening up&quot;.  Some animators used to say that their rough work would go to the clean up artists to get stiffened up, because the clean-ups tend to take away some of the added nuances that the rough artists did, by being so model driven and it would also take away from some of the animation because a drawing might employ an animation technique which would break model to pull off something.",2015-02-28T04:42:15Z
GameGrumps,Anybody else want Arin to do like a &quot;History of Animation&quot; series or is that just me?,2015-02-28T23:33:43Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zECyScTeQ4&amp;t=8m50s"">8:50</a><br><br>I have NEVER laughed as hard as I did when Danny screamed there",2015-02-28T21:17:57Z
GameGrumps,"I think the king bubbles actually look like Sinistar.<br><br>Also 101 Dalmatians came out in &#39;61, and that was in fact the start of using Xerography due to the fact Sleeping Beauty didn&#39;t rake in enough dough to support itself.",2015-02-27T18:16:19Z
GameGrumps,"I really enjoyed watching this part. I agree with you that the leaping birds are the hardest enemies in the game to destroy, especially the blue ones. I know what their weakness is, though! This is a little tricky to explain: What you do is stand about 3 blocks away from him and do your best to shield off the swords that he throws at you. When he jumps over you, do the jump thrust when you are directly below him.",2020-06-11T05:51:07Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zECyScTeQ4&amp;t=5m56s"">5:56</a><br>I couldn&#39;t agree more.  Those statues are supposed to have a 1-in-3 chance of providing the red jar, and that was the third time in a row that particular statue gave you the bird.",2020-03-27T07:10:24Z
GameGrumps,The depth perception made by the barred windows in this dungeon is really good for its time!,2015-02-27T21:18:24Z
GameGrumps,Last night I dreamt I was walking downstairs with two jars of Ragu and told my friend that I was down with the thickness.,2015-02-27T19:29:19Z
GameGrumps,I can&#39;t wait to see their reaction to the boss.,2015-02-28T22:39:27Z
GameGrumps,Real talk<br>I&#39;m not ready to let this series to end :(,2015-02-27T19:00:11Z
GameGrumps,I love Zelda 2 and the grumps make it even more enjoyable,2015-02-27T21:09:43Z
GameGrumps,Truly the Dark Souls of Danny&#39;s life<br><br>this series is great,2015-03-01T18:05:11Z
GameGrumps,"Keep punching through, Danny! You can do it! !",2015-02-28T13:06:37Z
GameGrumps,"Wow, Dan really got stomped on this run. This game is brutal.",2015-02-27T18:22:44Z
GameGrumps,"After watching Arin completely neglect his shield in Ocarina of Time, I appreciate Danny similarly neglecting his Shield spell in Adventure of Link.",2022-05-03T16:02:55Z
GameGrumps,The realest scream Dan has ever made happened in this episode. History for ya.,2015-02-28T07:49:10Z
GameGrumps,"Man, Arin is teaching Dan good thoughts about art lately (this time about shot language).",2015-02-28T00:48:53Z
GameGrumps,"aw, i&#39;m sad to see danny suffering in this level but i&#39;m experiencing a bit of schadenfreude as well cuz it&#39;s cute. getting frustrated means you&#39;re at least interested and that&#39;s all that matters to me",2015-02-27T20:01:49Z
GameGrumps,Imagine how much life Dan would save if he&#39;d stop body-checking enemies in an attempt to bypass them? lol,2018-03-03T10:17:31Z
GameGrumps,This episode was funny and I enjoyed it.,2015-02-27T18:49:19Z
GameGrumps,"Holy crap, it&#39;s not very often you hear Danny scream outright.",2017-08-12T03:44:05Z
GameGrumps,Let us all take a moment to appreciate the game showing its one and only instance of mercy by letting Dan restart at the entrance to the palace instead of at the beginning. ,2015-02-28T22:58:00Z
GameGrumps,Yes Dan! The Black Cauldron is amazing!<br>Gotta love Gurgi!,2015-02-27T19:12:43Z
GameGrumps,This is the first game I ever owned that I didn&#39;t bother to complete. I had not idea how to beat the boss. Years after I gave up someone showed me the trick and how easy it actually was. Even after I learned how I didn&#39;t bother to go back and complete it because getting through this last dungeon is simply a nightmare. I might actually dust off my copy now that I know about the life spell because I didn&#39;t even have that.,2015-02-28T00:47:10Z
GameGrumps,"I would love to see Dan replay this and actually do it well, like they did with the Mike Tyson replay.",2015-09-07T21:59:15Z
GameGrumps,What makes that harpy enemy funnier is that her species name (According to the Zelda Wiki) is Fokkeru. And she&#39;s related to another class of enemy simply called Fokka. So that&#39;s neat.,2015-02-27T22:14:07Z
GameGrumps,"Hey Danny, you know those bird knights that throw the daggers at you? The easiest way to deal with them is to hang back and wait for them to jump. Intersect their jump with an up thrust.",2015-02-27T23:31:50Z
GameGrumps,"I like that the last dungeon looks like it could of been made out of Toblerones, the scariest of all European chocolate bars.",2015-02-27T18:38:38Z
GameGrumps,I love the black cauldron too! It&#39;s one of my favorites,2016-12-20T11:25:39Z
GameGrumps,Is it just me or would the shield spell have really come in handy here?,2015-03-01T05:00:52Z
GameGrumps,"I don&#39;t know if anybody has mentioned this before, but the red potions actually restore more than 100% of your magic. If you pick one up, pause, then cast life before your magic meter is full it will keep filling it up almost to full.",2015-03-10T00:36:29Z
GameGrumps,Watching Dan and that statue made me think of &quot; Do you know what the definition of insanity is?&quot;,2015-02-27T20:02:48Z
GameGrumps,i love disney&#39;s dark era. the guidelines in their animated movies is nostalgic for me.,2015-02-27T21:51:12Z
GameGrumps,I really wish they named their link &quot;Buttlett&quot; again that was my favorite name they have ever used. It rolled of the tongue so well,2015-03-04T01:23:23Z
GameGrumps,The reason they make the flat line noise a pleasant musical tone is so that the doctor doesn&#39;t panic and cause more complications.,2015-02-27T18:34:20Z
GameGrumps,"<a href=""http://youtu.be/5zECyScTeQ4?t=8m52s"">8:52</a> one of the super real Dan screams XD",2015-03-30T10:10:40Z
GameGrumps,I flipping love the music for the Great Palace.,2015-02-27T20:52:34Z
GameGrumps,"Interesting bit of trivia.  In the Japanese version of the game, Link would start at the beginning of a Palace if you got a Game Over while inside, but in the final dungeon, you would get sent all the way back to the North Palace, while in the US version it was reversed.",2017-09-14T11:14:17Z
GameGrumps,"No one has commented on the vast difference of length this series took contrast to Wind Waker HD yet. Like, I know it&#39;s pretty obvious being 30 some years apart, but like wow. This series will most likely end on part 23; but Wind Waker HD was 73 episodes. And I&#39;m sure this could&#39;ve taken a lot longer had Danny not been using a guide, but just wow. Technology is amazing! :3<br><br>Also just want to point out how AMAZING this little short series has been guys! I normally enjoy them to an extant, but Pokemon, Wind Waker HD and some of there 1-offs are just fantastic. This one I think was another massively successful one Grumps! Maybe next you should do another Zelda title like Minish Cap.",2015-02-28T10:09:32Z
GameGrumps,"Hey Dan, you would have a much easier time if you used the shield spell more often than the life spell. Give it a try!",2015-02-27T21:01:54Z
GameGrumps,"Danny, you know this by now that you must fight your inner demons, and not run from them, do not run from the zelda monsters, FIGHT them! You are a warrior damn it!",2015-02-27T19:42:10Z
GameGrumps,This is why you don&#39;t put any of the crystals in the palaces until you are ready to beat the game. Each time you place a crystal you get an extra life. You stack the extra lives then do the final run.,2015-02-28T15:35:46Z
GameGrumps,198-FUCK! What a great year for music that was.,2015-02-27T18:55:28Z
GameGrumps,Restarting in the Great Palace after a game over is the one mercy this game shows you.,2015-02-27T19:37:49Z
GameGrumps,Black Cauldron is amazing. I think Arin is thinking of The Sword in the Stone,2015-02-27T18:47:52Z
Youtuber,Comments,Date
CoryxKenshin,Cory pretty much just predicted about half of the FNAF 4 lore...<br><br>THIS is why he&#39;s the greatest,2017-08-14T23:12:11Z
CoryxKenshin,Wow Cory was actually right on the theory about them being nightmares!,2019-12-14T11:41:25Z
CoryxKenshin,I like how they combined all 3 screams,2015-07-14T03:39:22Z
CoryxKenshin,Your last chance to try to defeat me. Try.,2015-07-14T00:49:31Z
CoryxKenshin,"Guys, remember how Scott said that he had a nightmare of Bonnie in his bedroom? What if this time we are playing through the mind of Scott in HIS nightmares.",2015-07-14T01:14:10Z
CoryxKenshin,I can only imagine how sick this must’ve been back in 2015,2021-05-25T23:27:08Z
CoryxKenshin,This was the first video I’ve ever watched of CoryxKenshin. This video means a lot to me.,2020-01-04T06:53:05Z
CoryxKenshin,The fnaf 4 trailer gives me chills to this day,2020-12-17T13:00:23Z
CoryxKenshin,Remember the ending to fnaf 3? Where we see the news article and it says that some items will be sold at auction. What if in this game we bought some items from that auction... perhaps? The things we got are now haunting our house? I have no idea but I&#39;m so pumped for the game!!,2015-07-14T00:20:44Z
CoryxKenshin,Crazy how Cory went from playing  the fnaf games to being in the movie,2023-06-28T04:31:35Z
CoryxKenshin,"This is my theory, Cory. The bedroom looked like a kid&#39;s bedroom. Maybe you&#39;re playing as the kid who was bitten in the Bite of &#39;87? It seemed kinda logical to me.",2015-07-14T02:12:13Z
CoryxKenshin,This was the VERY first video I watched for Cory I’ve been here for two years through his crazy disappearance I always wait for him to come back and he always has 😇,2018-05-30T06:34:10Z
CoryxKenshin,"First theory: I remember one of the first pictures Scott released looked as if Freddy&#39;s hat and other things were under a spotlight, like an auction. So my guess is that someone bought literally everything found at each restaurant and now the things are coming to life in their house. The miniature animatronics can be explained as the toys you see in FNaF 2 on the shelves in the Marionette&#39;s room!<br><br>Second theory: The person who had their frontal lobe bitten off could be having these nightmares. My guess is that the traumatic event that happened to that person caused them to block any memories that has anything to do with Freddy Fazzbear pizzeria. Now it&#39;s all coming back to them and they have nights of terror trying to run away from the hallucinations the memories are causing them!<br><br>Fingers crossed that one of these theories are correct, can&#39;t wait to see a brother play it! And what gets me excited is that the graphics look so different from the other FNaF games, I hope that it wasn&#39;t just for the trailer and that it actually looks like this! ヾ(<b>´∀｀</b>)ﾉ",2015-07-14T00:13:58Z
CoryxKenshin,"Wow, I had an idea like this since the beginning - having to hide from/ward off the animatronics inside your own home, or in whatever freaking house that is. I just recorded my reaction (But I&#39;m definitely keeping it to myself XD) and at the very beginning I just shouted at the top of my lungs, &quot;I KNEW IT!!!&quot; about five times. :P",2015-07-14T00:42:25Z
CoryxKenshin,am i the only one that feels like this is gonna make a huge success and scott will make a fifth one? in fredbear?,2015-07-13T23:45:17Z
CoryxKenshin,"Nice theory, it makes sense and would tie things together. I&#39;m very interested to see how this plays out. :D",2015-07-14T17:10:51Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;I hope Freddy ready to get his ankles broke&quot;<br><br><b>dies</b>,2015-07-14T00:20:27Z
CoryxKenshin,"He&#39;s gonna get like 5,000 more subscribers when he play it",2015-07-13T23:38:44Z
CoryxKenshin,Pay attention to the player&#39;s perspective. You play as a child. You&#39;re eye-level with the doorknobs and only slightly taller than the bed.,2015-07-13T23:51:34Z
CoryxKenshin,Dude! I am so psyched to see you play this man!<br><br>P.S. - Glad to see you doing so well! Still remember when you only had 100 subs- Only up from here Samurai!!,2015-07-14T00:50:25Z
CoryxKenshin,"Little did Cory know, he hit the nail on the head with that theory",2017-10-28T11:22:16Z
CoryxKenshin,"wow this is the first time I saw the trailer on this channel for fnaf 4, I hope you achieve great things someday cory.<br>-Quinnlan Boyd",2015-07-14T06:08:31Z
CoryxKenshin,Looking back at this cory&#39;s theory is basically spot on 🤔,2021-09-02T18:08:12Z
CoryxKenshin,All I can say is... hype. These FNAF games are not what they appear to be. They are fun and scary but at the same time Scott has put a lot of thought into it. Enough so that even Game Theory had to try and look for a deeper meaning.,2015-07-14T04:16:47Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;That wasn&#39;t a restuarant&quot; Lmao 😂,2019-06-28T21:42:10Z
CoryxKenshin,Already a trailer? This is insane! :o,2015-07-13T23:40:32Z
CoryxKenshin,I called it! I SO CALLED IT! I knew the final chapter would be about someone buying something they shouldn´t have! And you can actually move in this one! THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!,2015-07-14T17:08:48Z
CoryxKenshin,the fact that he was right when he said it was a nightmare is so funny,2022-02-07T02:59:24Z
CoryxKenshin,This video quality is so smooth it&#39;s like it&#39;s actual camera equipments on steroids,2015-07-14T20:53:53Z
CoryxKenshin,Bro really predicted the entire gameplay,2022-01-06T06:49:06Z
CoryxKenshin,Why does this remind me of Among the Sleep?,2015-07-14T00:57:53Z
CoryxKenshin,His theory is so accurate. Even from the trailer,2022-07-10T13:55:42Z
CoryxKenshin,The first time I saw this trailer I was much more scared than Cory was,2017-07-20T02:10:01Z
CoryxKenshin,"Cory, you should play Black Rose, it&#39;s a <b>really</b> good indie horror game, and it&#39;s for free on Game Jolt.<br>The developer has been reaching out for YouTubers, especially Markiplier, to get to play his expansion to the original version.<br>You won&#39;t be disappointed after playing this, and him knowing that there are people playing his game, he&#39;ll feel special again.",2015-07-14T00:07:04Z
CoryxKenshin,HYPE! I heard it&#39;s capped Bad Dreams or something but I know this is going to be super scary!,2015-07-14T01:10:26Z
CoryxKenshin,OMG!!! This is going to be sooo awesome and freaky! Foxy and all those weird little animatronics are so creepy!!! I can&#39;t wait for you to play it cory!!!👍👍👍😱,2015-07-14T10:15:47Z
CoryxKenshin,"Childs voice: Daddy, I see monsters...<br>Dads voice: oh well, here have this plush, it&#39;s a yellow bunny! I got it from the auction! Just for you my angel!<br>Theory. Set. Motion.",2015-07-14T22:03:47Z
CoryxKenshin,Can&#39;t wait for this!,2015-07-14T00:32:49Z
CoryxKenshin,Wow look how far we’ve come. It makes me so happy,2020-11-07T02:56:14Z
CoryxKenshin,Ho-ly cow. That trailer had the feel of an 80s horror flick commercial! Did anyone else get that vibe?,2015-07-13T23:51:45Z
CoryxKenshin,"Came back here in 2022 and laughed when he said &quot;this is it guys, the final chapter&quot;",2022-03-14T23:54:31Z
CoryxKenshin,Surprised that Cory figured out that fnaf 4 was all a nightmare just from the trailer.   Ok Cory I seee youuu,2020-06-29T00:29:53Z
CoryxKenshin,"I think it&#39;s a house because remember in the last one there was an auction. There were parts of Springboob in there and someone might have bought that home, hence the whole &quot;what have you brought home&quot; question <br><br>Well, that&#39;s what I think anyway",2015-07-14T00:57:53Z
CoryxKenshin,"Considering the name of the springtrap doll is plushtrap, perhaps those &quot;few items&quot; that survived are the plush dolls on the security desk from the previous games. Perhaps you have to find a way to get the plushtrap out your home and every night springtrap (in the doll) haunts you with the phantoms (now nightmare) to kill one more kid. Or maybe it&#39;s a completely different spirit involved as there is Fredbear now too. Regardless, this is starting to sound like Annabelle the rag doll.",2015-07-14T02:43:10Z
CoryxKenshin,Maybe Scott could fit it all in the restaurant and had to take it home😂,2015-07-16T14:37:39Z
CoryxKenshin,I can&#39;t wait for it to come out,2015-07-20T21:52:22Z
CoryxKenshin,"Wow, that moment when Cory&#39;s theory was right...and He JUST watched the frickin VIDEO..",2016-05-26T17:46:04Z
CoryxKenshin,"It looks sooo good, I was waiting for ur vid Cory!!",2015-07-13T23:45:33Z
CoryxKenshin,"Heh, when you come back Cory you&#39;ll have a whole new FNAF to deal with.",2016-07-15T18:07:53Z
CoryxKenshin,Scott really outdid himself!,2015-07-14T12:37:18Z
CoryxKenshin,The best part about this is that at first it seems all silly and weird and then suddenly it gets so dark the rest of the way... And then eeven darker... ...,2015-07-14T00:35:17Z

CoryxKenshin,Lowkey wanted to rewatch my favorite CoryxKenshin series. Cory is such a goat,2021-10-20T12:06:31Z

CoryxKenshin,Thank you for everything Cory!,2023-04-17T18:00:21Z
CoryxKenshin,"Facts!! No one can stop you from achieving your goals or dreams except for you!! I love that you highlighted the fact that people will see you doing good then try to sabotage you by putting something in your head. I used to think that i would stay in retail pharmacy forever because someone told me that i had to be Nationally Certified to work at a compound pharmacy, but here I am. STYATE CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECHNICIAN, working in a compound pharmacy. The only person that got me here was ME. I loved this video. Very different from the gameplay, but it lets us know that you are more than just the surface, more than just a youtuber. Thanks for this. You just reaffirmed my beliefs. Hope your day is going good, Fellow Blerd ^-^",2022-03-29T15:28:29Z
CoryxKenshin,"Thank you, Brother Cory. May our blessings be bountiful, and the algorithm, merciful. Amen, and awomen.",2021-09-18T22:31:47Z
CoryxKenshin,Wow. Motivational videos usually don&#39;t work for me but this makes me wanna get tf up and put in the work,2023-08-09T17:49:30Z
CoryxKenshin,"You spoke directly to me when you said &quot;If you&#39;re good at animating and put time into it, you will work at Bungie,&quot; because since 2019 I&#39;ve been wanting to be an animator at Bungie, but I guess I am putting a limit on myself. I&#39;m currently working to get my Computer Science degree.<br><br>My grades are great; it&#39;s not anything I&#39;m struggling on, but I want to be an animator. I have barely touched animation softwares, but I know inside that it&#39;s what I want to do. I&#39;ve got so many ideas that I believe are good, but I keep telling myself that &quot;School comes first.&quot;<br><br>I also have games that I want to play with friends; in your analogy you said &quot;scrolling through TikTok&quot; and it&#39;s the same thing. I play games with friends for immediate gratification, whereas animating takes time to get that feeling. I always try to do something whenever they&#39;re not online; that&#39;s my window of time. If I try to get creative while they&#39;re online, I can feel their pull and decide to hop on. I&#39;m not addicted to games, but when down to 2 choices, between playing games with friends and learning animation, I keep choosing the games option, and every single night I feel guilty that I didn&#39;t do squat with animation. I choose to do that instead of practicing 3D animation, or practicing how to draw. It&#39;s a loop I am in, and like I said, every night all the productivity I built up for animating hits me in bed.<br><br>I&#39;m telling myself that I must take a course during any breaks that pop up, and play games with the boys on weekends, and hopefully that objective will be fulfilled. I want to create things. I want to create my own characters, my own stories, my own everything. But I need to start, AND commit, and both of those things are notoriously hard to do with any hobby/career.<br><br>I need to start man...",2021-10-06T08:40:20Z

CoryxKenshin,Ngl.. I almost cried in the restroom listening to CoryxKenshin No limit video I’ve seen this video but never watched it but I believe God kept it that way because I truly needed that message today… Life has been a roller coaster this year… and at that most it’s been a Unbalanced one… I wait for the days it will feel stable and I be limiting myself and making excuses but hearing Cory speak so firm and whole heartedly about not limiting our self really hit the spot … This is truly a light in my dark path… Thank you @CoryxKenshin ☮️💜✝️,2021-11-28T18:55:22Z

Technoblade,"I get stardark may be disrespectful at time, but it&#39;s not like people aren&#39;t way worse to him. People like Mirbeast, Insta, and luke in the second clip are the reasons why I don&#39;t like to play on hypixel. You never know what will turn into harassment.",2015-03-27T02:35:59Z

Technoblade,"Because of this, I now believe that stardark only teams (since his previous ban) not that he wants to, or wants the hate, but because he&#39;s scared of situations or people like THIS going around targeting him in massive teams.<br><br>Yes it is sort of the old &#39;taste of your own medicine&#39; type of deal, but revenge really isn&#39;t the way to go.<br>It hurts both people that way.<br><br>It&#39;s sad really about this.",2015-03-27T00:17:23Z

Luke is an amazing example on how ex-staff usually act, and its sad. Him his friends or whatever they are just make the community even worse than it already is. Even though I dislike many people on the server, I don&#39;t go out of my way to target / trash talk and harass them continuously.",2015-03-27T03:18:52Z

Technoblade,"I have to say, i think baker 9 is the most powerful level 9, as if you have any threats at all with a regular kit, you basically diminish that to 0. As if you eat the gapple, you have absorption, 2 extra hearts. and 14 seconds of resist 2. It&#39;s basically a win in any small room and if someone is chasing me (and im below half) i pot turn around and destroy their face. Scout 9 could easily out strafe a baker on flat ground but baker is very good in tight situations or if you&#39;re being targetted.",2014-10-11T02:16:26Z

iHasCupquake,Hey Tiffany! Can you name the t-Rex Wretched? It&#39;s not a desert but I think your hostile Dino&#39;s should be named after lethal (dangerous/or sounds dangerous) names. Thanks you for reading!<br>~SimplyHoney,2014-03-02T22:45:44Z
iHasCupquake,I wish I commented when watching this years ago that when the T. rex first spawns it’s absolutely adorable and SO SMALL. like smaller then 1x1 block wise. Which is why cupquake couldn’t see him. Lol.,2017-12-04T11:00:00Z

iHasCupquake,To tame a big cat u have to tame them when there baby&#39;s otherwise it doesn&#39;t work! Your welcome!,2015-02-24T10:59:42Z
iHasCupquake,"A T-rex can only be tamed when it is fully mature (10 Minecraft days). First, you must keep beating down the T-rex until it is unconscious and sleeping. The T-rex will only stay sleeping for 30 seconds. After that, it will collapse and die. While it is sleeping you have to right click it with a scarab gem. The T-rex will wake up fully healed and no longer have red evil eyes. You can also ride the T-rex.",2014-03-03T16:14:01Z

By the way, this is not an argument, and I&#39;m sorry but do you even OWN Minecraft? I thought so. Players have not been able to hit TNT to ignite it since the 1.7 update, and it requires to be lit on fire or to be activated with redstone.

iHasCupquake,Potatoe Shoes have a different meaning down south at least in North Carolina. I grew up in a really poor area and alot of the student&#39;s couldn&#39;t afford shoes so they just wore the same old beaten up shoes. So the school literally would take the bag&#39;s the potatoes came in and would cut them out in the shape of a shoe and they would give them to student&#39;s to wear over the shoes to keep the feet warm and dry and we called them potatoe shoes.,2011-12-02T00:47:51Z

MegMage,"Leave it to me to find the weirdest possible outcomes for this 11 year old game 😂 both Mynt and Meg are so chaotic. I understand there might be consequences, but we&#39;re sticking with our gut instincts! So thankful y&#39;all are along for the ride! Also, can we admire Isolde&#39;s voice acting in that scene? 😭",2021-09-20T16:56:08Z
MegMage,Mynt: <b>says mean things to Morrigan</b><br>Morrigan: <b>disapproves</b><br>Meg: <b>surprised Pikachu face</b><br><br>That was really funny :D,2022-10-12T09:58:17Z
MegMage,"Also, you might find this hard to believe but Sten actually loves it when you acknowledge or positively respond to any of his jokes and sarcastic quips. That&#39;s why you got +16 approval despite the sheer awkwardness of your conversation with him. He also likes it when you show curiosity over his people and avoid making snap judgments.",2021-09-21T04:51:22Z
MegMage,"Before this game the choices have been pretty cut and dry, good/evil, but when I had to choose between killing a kid or killing his mom. I had to put the controller down and really think about this one. I ended up sacrificing the mom my first time through, little did I know, that there was a hidden paragon option, only hinted at in the dialogue.",2021-09-20T18:57:32Z

However, I will ask what your decision was regarding Connor - What was your choice?",2021-09-20T21:25:51Z
MegMage,"I actually love that you ended up with that Connor outcome instead of the others, even though it mostly happened cause exploring got the better of you loll. people need to realize though someone playing this game for the very first time and not knowing anything about it going in is not gonna get the perfect happy ending to every quest. How could she know that she had to leave and do the whole circle quest line and then come back to save Connor? No one would know that the first time unless you looked it up",2021-09-20T17:36:37Z
MegMage,"I always thought they missed an opportunity, Jowan was cut as a party member early on. You would be able to use the Gary Warden right of recruitment to force them to let him join the party. I thought that be pretty funny coming full circle from the right of recruitment being used at the circle.",2021-09-20T16:08:57Z
MegMage,It was pretty hilarious watching you stumble your way into what is probably the second worst outcome for Redcliff arc. I really enjoyed your reactions as they were happening.<br>In my first playthrough I went for almost exactly the same outcome with you except I took the burden of killing Connor with my warden. Not sure which is worse now but at that time it felt like a better choice than letting Isolde kill him.,2021-09-21T03:20:58Z
MegMage,"Respect you for sticking with it even with the horribly sad outcome. Sadly you don&#39;t get much warning (especially if you&#39;ve never played it) that if you go upstairs you can be railroaded into Connor dying via Isolde. You pretty much have to agree to do Jowan&#39;s ritual on the spot or, (since by this point I&#39;ve always let him go and told him to escape so it&#39;s not an option) you ask if there&#39;s another way to enter the fade. I actually didn&#39;t know you <b>could</b> go upstairs and talk to Connor without triggering the demon, and I&#39;ve played this for years. I think what messed you up was going to the door to Eamon&#39;s room, which triggered the demon to attack. Poor Connor :( I always end up saving him via the non blood magic way, but my warden is a goody two shoes who wants to save everyone. I personally despise Isolde for how she treated Alistair, but even I feel sorry for her since she clearly loves her child and the thought of a mother being forced to murder her kid is just so sad :(",2021-09-21T04:02:04Z
MegMage,"It was so interesting to see this outcome for Connor! I knew it existed but I haven&#39;t seen it before, as I usually go to the mages in the Tower to cure Connor. But I loved the voice acting of Isolde in that scene - so raw and powerful. It really tugs at the heart. I respect that you stood by this decision! I also love that you play Mynt as someone who sticks to her beliefs and decisions without changing herself to please other people. That&#39;s refreshing and fun to watch 😄",2022-12-07T05:02:13Z
MegMage,"Already knew from the thumbnail what decision you made (Connor&#39;s demon only shows up outside the Fade if you tried to kill Connor or got too close to the Arl) and honestly, I&#39;m not surprised. I made the same mistake on my first playthrough as well. It happens. The optimal outcome, if you aren&#39;t aware, is going to the Circle of Magi and getting them to exorcise the demon without any sacrifices. Unfortunately, not sure if someone already told you this but, if you&#39;re looking to be a Blood Mage, you&#39;ve lost the only opportunity to learn it in this game (not counting the expansion). Mynt has to confront the demon in the Fade to learn Blood Magic, which the other two options would allow. Otherwise, respect for not going back to a previous save.",2021-09-21T04:35:36Z
MegMage,Well I&#39;ve never seen that ending to Connor&#39;s story before... so thanks I guess for showing it? <br><br>I tend to go for the option that saves both Connor and Isolde but it does require asking for alternatives to the blood magic ritual to unlock and a vist to the Circle.<br><br>Also RIP Owen&#39;s daughter Valena since you didn&#39;t find her in time because you didn&#39;t check the final door in a corridor last episode.,2021-09-21T17:59:33Z
MegMage,"I love this game so much, the replay value and the branching choices are so well done.",2021-09-20T18:48:07Z
MegMage,"This is so crazy. I made an elven mage like you, but my mage trusted the first enchanter and the circle of magi, so I betrayed Jowan at the start of the story. When I got to this part of the story, I immediately was just like &quot;Yeah lets go to the first enchanter and circle of magi for help&quot; and didn&#39;t even think of any other options. Seeing you think and choose exactly opposite of me is so incredibly interesting.",2023-04-01T06:04:31Z
MegMage,"Yep, one of the darker solutions, stuff happens on first playthroughs.<br>Has your chat mentioned that Liliana is very handy with a sword?  I like to put points in her dual wielding and equip her with sword&amp;dagger in slot 1 and have bow&amp;arrow in 2nd weapon slot.  She automatically switches to sword when enemies get in here face, and because of her high dexterity can fight without taking much damage.<br> I also level her lock picking up to max because blowing chest up damages the contents.",2021-09-20T20:07:39Z
MegMage,This was tough seeing Isolde kill Connor but I am not at all unhappy you received this outcome for them. It really hits home that the game has different consequences for different actions each player may take. Getting to see your reactions to those consequences is a true highlight of this play through. I commend not re-loading or looking it up and this is really solidifying itself as the best DA:O play through I’ve watched.,2022-02-22T17:52:51Z
MegMage,Dragon Age choices and outcomes are more complicated than Mass Effect choices 😂,2021-09-21T04:44:45Z
MegMage,Jowan is that one friend that just keeps fucking up and making situations worse.,2021-09-20T21:54:59Z
MegMage,In my first playthrough I also didn&#39;t get &quot;paragon&quot; result when it comes to Redcliff. I went with Jowan Ritual. If you wonder - there is option to use mages and lyrium instead of blood magic and Izolde but you need first to complete Broken Circle (Mage questline for Blight). <br><br>Good to see you fiddling with mods. Shame you didn&#39;t had more cosmetics at the character creation. I usually add 2 mods worth of hairstyles and colors which allows making more unique player characters.,2021-09-20T22:56:31Z
MegMage,"Those unique Feastday DLC gifts in Bodahn&#39;s shop are more dangerous than any forbidden magic. If a companion&#39;s approval level increases to the next threshold (where it gives a stat bonus and usually unlocks new dialogue options) without first completing the previously unlocked dialogue paths, then some of the dialogue you haven&#39;t yet listened to can and will become unavailable, which can lead to sequence breaking and bugging stuff with that companion.",2023-05-16T16:29:27Z
MegMage,"Ngl, this was really entertaining, and it&#39;s so refreshing to see someone actually not get the &quot;best ending&quot; for a change! Truly blind playtroughs are great. That said, the amount of friendly fire had me feeling a bit stressed...? Poor Leliana died a lot due to Mynt&#39;s freezing her and enemies walking right up to her and attacking (I believe they deal extra damage/can&#39;t miss if you are frozen, something like that, it&#39;s been awhile since I read on the battle system). <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a> Well, you seem to be having fun, so that&#39;s what matters. But ouchie! All those healing kits. Hahaha",2022-11-19T10:19:46Z
MegMage,"People who are fans of this game like to go on and on about the horrible stuff you can do and the choices that are really hard but when people do make them, there&#39;s definitely a certain Best choice that people have picked for themselves and so it creates this whole conflict of &quot;how could you do that&quot;. Don&#39;t worry about it, I did so much stuff my first playthrough through ignorance and I enjoyed it anyway.",2021-11-05T16:26:54Z
MegMage,"There are no right or wrong choices. It is just a video game and if there is an option given by the developers, there is nothing wrong in taking it. Don’t understand the complaints. Play it your way. 👍🏼",2021-09-20T16:24:51Z
MegMage,The good news about RPG&#39;s is that there&#39;s so many choices that you can play the game again to get all the other outcomes!<br><br>Play Dragon Age to death!,2021-09-20T20:53:18Z
MegMage,"Personally I don&#39;t get all the hate Isolde gets, she was a desperate mother who didn&#39;t want to loose her son, when a child is taken to the circle they&#39;re not allowed to ever see their family again, of course she didn&#39;t want anyone to find out he had magic.<br>More than anything I get confused when people hate Isolde yet are okay with Jowans part in it?",2021-11-08T18:45:08Z

MegMage,"Wow, never seen seen that ending to Connor&#39;s story before, how sad. I always go to the tower circle and do the mage/lyrium/ go into the fade ending where everyone lives. I wondered why you didn&#39;t pick option two when talking to Jowan, &quot;Is there no other option&quot;. Seems like you didn&#39;t notice it. Pretty sure that is what opens the dialogue to using Lyrium.",2023-01-06T11:31:19Z

I kind of have a current headcanon (obviously not knowing where you take Mynt with romances) that Leliana has a massive crush on her because of every time she says “I can do that for you” with locked chests. Like she’s trying to impress/get her attention (even though I know it’s just the game mechanic having a rogue in your party). <br><br>Love how chaotic she is too, makes for a fun watch of the game from an RPG point of view",2023-01-05T00:25:55Z

MegMage,"I’m so glad she played Rogue before Unity, I think she’ll be amazed by the intro of Unity and the new mechanics",2023-07-23T20:51:57Z
MegMage,"Achilles had been reluctant to acknowledge Shay&#39;s correctness until he personally laid eyes on the artifact. Both the Assassins and Templars believed the temple contained what seemed to be an &quot;ordinary&quot; artifact, possibly an Apple of Eden. There&#39;s even a moment when Liam questions Achilles, asking: &#39;Is this the Apple?&#39; as they look at the artifact. Inside the Temple, Achilles eventually admits that Shay is right and intervenes to prevent Liam from shooting him, finally realizing his mistake and showing a willingness to FORGIVE Shay (a contrast to Liam, who understandably succumbed to rage after witnessing Shay&#39;s actions that led to the demise of his friends and the destruction of their brotherhood; I also believe this is what led to Shay showing Achilles mercy, and the points Shay made were just to convince Haytham, which worked).<br><br>Liam&#39;s line stands out to me: &#39;I hope that world is a good one.&#39; He tries to make Shay contemplate the consequences of his actions – while he did stop the precursor crisis, he inadvertently granted ultimate power to the Assassins&#39; greatest enemy, the Templar Order.<br><br>Both sides have their flaws. Rogue&#39;s tragedy is a result of a giant misunderstanding and poor circumstances. Achilles changed after his entire family died, and Shay was being heckled by Chevalier (among other things), which caused him to change his view on the Assassins. Then, after the journey back from Lisbon, he decides to choose (to me) the worst possible course of action and betrays the Colonial Assassins, subsequently wiping them off the face of the Earth.<br><br>In an ideal world, Achilles would have handled the tremendous amount of grief, and Shay would have calmed down during his transoceanic journey. The two could then have a conversation and realize the risks that investigating the Voynich Manuscript Temples brought, leading them to change the Brotherhood for the better.",2023-07-23T15:07:13Z
MegMage,"I think Rogue has my favorite Ezio&#39;s Family arrangement. Great playthrough! One of the things I appreciate about this game is the WEIGHT each assassination has on Shay. Killing people, even bad people, should be hard for a good person. Is Shay a good person? I don&#39;t know, but I think he tries his best to be in his own flawed way. Excited for Unity!!",2023-07-23T15:08:12Z
MegMage,That ending always gives me the chills,2023-07-23T15:49:39Z
MegMage,I think the thing that this game was trying to tell us was: not all Templars are bad and not all Assassins are good,2023-07-23T16:01:24Z
MegMage,Achilles says he won&#39;t forget what happened but the world will. By not telling Connor I think he&#39;s keeping his word by not passing on the information that he knew even to other assassins.,2023-07-23T16:40:49Z
MegMage,"A lot of people like to complain about this game that they effectively just title swapped the Templars and Assassins, but I think that&#39;s kind of the point.<br><br>We&#39;ve always seen this conflict from the perspective of the Assassins. But think about how our actions in-game would look from the perspective of the Templars, who also think they&#39;re doing the right thing.<br><br>Hooded figures stalking the streets under their noses, slaughtering their coworkers and superiors, always afraid that a simple bump on the street with a stranger could be your last action in life. Using poisonous gases and injectable toxins, or simply bombarding their victims with knives, bullets or explosives. We (the character) essentially are terrorists, just ones who we (the player) know are doing the right thing because it&#39;s a video game.<br><br>It&#39;s not a flattering look. And it isn&#39;t helped when, occasionally, an Assassin brotherhood loses their way like Achilles&#39; had. Suddenly, they&#39;re just terrorists, without the &#39;protagonist morality armor&#39; behind them.",2023-07-23T15:45:18Z
MegMage,"One thing I like about Rogue is how it bridges the gaps between AC3, AC4, and AC Unity.<br>Adewale&#39;s conversation with Haytham about Edward in particular was an awesome moment.",2023-07-23T17:09:10Z
MegMage,"Well, I was going to share some thoughts on Achilles and his behavior throughout the game, but perhaps save that for the chat later. I would encourage finishing the computers and tablets for lore stuff though. <br><br>Now… this is my third favorite AC game, behind only Brotherhood and ACII. I just loved the refinement of everything I enjoyed in Black Flag, the setting, the story development and I did love the story of Shay’s fall. I can totally understand not liking Shay since he killed Ade though. As for where Unity is going… imagine me sitting here with a very Sphinx style smile as you are trying to figure out who the protag will be. You’ll see. And I cannot wait.<br><br>I will quietly encourage one thing - after Unity, check out the two part comic story The Fall and The Chain and Assassin’s Creed Chronicles. If only for lore, they’re going to be important heading into what’s to come.",2023-07-23T13:25:24Z
MegMage,"I gotta say,  you’ve come a long way Meg with Assassin’s Creed. <br>Rogue always seemed like the game that really gets you caught up with the series as both sides are fully explored.",2023-07-23T15:24:40Z
MegMage,"Really great concept behind this game. Could have been more emotionally engaging, especially the assassination dialogues. <br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t understand. Did Shay recover the Precursor Box? I know the Modern Day templars have it.<br><br>In the epilogue you got introduced to Charles Dorian and two kids. You will find out more about these connections as soon as you begin playing AC Unity.",2023-07-23T09:41:52Z
MegMage,Great job playing the game Megmage! I&#39;m glad you played it to learn about Achilles and the precursor disasters. Shay is good guy and he&#39;s another one of my favorite characters. &quot;I make my own luck&quot; Best quote ever.,2023-07-23T18:13:03Z

People are really dived about wether or not they like it, but I at the very least think it plays a really good part in the overall universe.<br>Also, small reminder to check out the Chronicles trilogy between Unity and Syndicate! They&#39;re a very different kind of game, but they&#39;re also really fun. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy seeing a few of the characters there!",2023-07-23T18:21:54Z

MegMage,"Hey meg, thanks for playing the AC Series! It&#39;s an amazing series with so many great games even at its lowest points, The main theme song for AC Rogue and the ending is really symbollic because as you already know the series was born on 7th gen consoles in 2007(Xbox 360, PS3, Wii) and this was the last game before the transition for the ps4 AC era so it carries so many emotions for veteran players who accompanied the series up to that point in 2014, AC Unity is next and i can&#39;t wait to see you play! it has the best parkour system in the series, the visuals and the Soundtrack are also amazing! the problem with the parkour is that it&#39;s badly explained on the tutorials but i recommend you react to some people doing crazy things with Unity parkour after you finish a few sequences :) I can guarantee you&#39;re gonna be blown away by that game.",2023-07-23T16:15:36Z

So I&#39;ll spare you wise Words about this Game and who deserves or doesn&#39;t deserve anything. No I just want to say Thank you Meg for giving this Game a Chance and seeing it through to the End. I know not everyone likes this Game but I still find it to be one of the most underrated AC Games just like Revelations. I also found it very powerful that Achilles admitted at the End that Shay was right and he and the Assassins were wrong.<br>Thanks Meg for today&#39;s Episode and I look forward to continuing with AC Unity.

MegMage,"When Connor came to Achilles to study, he didn&#39;t say anything about the Neck. Because Achilles no longer considered him a traitor, but believed that the assassins betrayed him when they did not listen to what he was talking about. Because of the earthquake that happened in Lisbon, Shay just went crazy. After that, he decides to stop the assassins and thereby atone for the destruction of the city and the dead people. As a result, he became a Templar and helped them take power in the American colonies. But Shay, before going over to the side of the Templars, logically did not think that if the Templars had found this temple in Lisbon first, then the same earthquake would have happened, since they were also looking for temples. If Shay had just calmly told what happened in Lisbon, and not attacked Achilles and other assassins with accusations, then there would have been no assassin deaths. Achilles and the other assassins had nothing to do with it at all. They thought that the Apple of Eden was there, so they did not stop searching, but continued to search. <br><br>When Shay Cormac killed Charles Dorian, he found the box, he began to travel the world and look for artifacts. During this, he had a family and for this he was not surrounded by Connor. Later, his son and grandson followed in his footsteps and also became Templars. <br><br>Modern Templars, through the memoirs of Shay Cormac, found out that the Assassins do not really want freedom, but order, and the Templars represent the highest order. It can be said that on behalf of the Templars, the Assassins bring chaos, and on behalf of the Assassins, the Templars bring chaos. It says, but that the Assassins and Templars personify order and chaos. Everything depends on their actions. This theme will be explored more in Assassin&#39;s Creed: Odyssey. <br><br>At the end, the nameless Abstergo analyst becomes a Templar, and the nameless Abstergo analyst who was in Assassin&#39;s Creed 4: Black Flag quit Abstergo, and the Templars hunted him down and killed him because he leaked information to the Assassins.",2023-07-24T00:33:20Z

MegMage,"Rogue was released at the same time as Unity, but on different console generations. If you owned an Xbox One or PS4 you likely played Unity first, and maybe picked up Rogue later if you still had your old console available (and nothing better to play). If you did it in that order (which I&#39;m guessing a lot of people did?) you knew fully well who Charles Dorian was.",2023-07-23T16:40:50Z

MegMage,"Achilles was told by a trusted Assassin (Shay) what these artefacts have been causing, and rather than heeding the caution, they decided to shut Shay down, and pursue the rest of the artefacts. Achilles was reckless and egotistical.<br>Shay on the other hand, did not chase them down out of mere spite, and a case of a fragile ego, the man felt responsible for every soul lost in Lisbon, the Assassins refused to heed his words, but the Templars did. Every one can say whatever.. but I say it again, the Assassins of the American rite, had to go. While Shay did not enjoy it, he knew it was necessary.<br>Edit; Gotta add that this is from my POV, nothing official.",2023-07-23T22:09:16Z

In 1763, three years after the Assassins&#39; defeat at the Arctic, the Templars launched their final attack on the Davenport Homestead, killing all of the remaining Assassins save for Achilles and Robert Faulkner. Convinced that the lone Mentor no longer posed any threat, the Templars spared Achilles&#39; life once again, this time on the condition that he give up his life as an Assassin. You can see why he was so depressed and had given up on the Assassins completely.",2023-07-23T15:23:52Z

MegMage,"You preach empathy all of the time, but it seems like your empathy is selective. Your empathy is lacking for people who stand up against you or have opposing views. Just an observation I’ve been noticing. But you’re entitled to your feelings",2021-07-22T17:18:45Z

MegMage,"This game has the best boss battles/gameplay in the entire franchise, this is why most OG GΩW fans fell in love with this series, to blow off some steam from whatever they were personally going through and trying to find a release just like Kratos.",2021-10-15T18:19:09Z
MegMage,I love that you show emotion during your game playthroughs! Means you&#39;re being passionate about them and genuinely get invested in the stories and characters.,2021-10-15T17:04:31Z
MegMage,I don&#39;t think the voice acting in these games gets enough credit. That opening Zeus monolog is just so good and performed so well. <br><br>By the way good luck with your wedding tomorrow and congratulations again.,2021-10-16T02:38:04Z

In short, you don&#39;t actually have to pay too much attention to the button prompts themselves; just focus on which side of the screen is flashing.",2021-10-15T19:15:00Z
MegMage,"That is why loyal GOW fans who played all the original series can feel the emotions and understand the references in GOW4 (2018). When we see the Blades of Chaos in GOW4, we all legit shed tears. &quot;You&#39;re as beautiful as the day I lost you&quot; is the first thing I said when I saw the Blades and later got to use and flex them on the Hel-Walkers. Most people thought it&#39;s the Blades of Exile from GOW3, but no, it was the ORIGINAL Blades of Chaos that Ares bound and seared unto his flesh and then later ripped out from him all the way back in GOW1. I understood the references and I knew why Kratos hated those Blades. Still, in GOW4, the Blades finally redeemed itself. When in GOW1 Kratos used it to slaughter his first family, now in GOW4 he is using it instead to save the only family he had left. It is almost poetic",2022-08-16T18:20:11Z
MegMage,"I&#39;m glad that you get emotional with these games. It means that you really enjoy the stories and are getting invested in the characters. If you&#39;re looking to get some more emotion out of the God of War games, I do recommend playing the God of War games Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta. They&#39;re not as long as the trilogy because they originally were made for the PSP, but they have some of the most emotional and heartbreaking moments in the franchise.",2021-10-16T02:45:50Z
MegMage,"These series are very fun to watch and your reactions are amazing, can&#39;t wait to see more",2021-10-17T20:30:39Z
MegMage,Yeah that up-close and personal fight with Poseidon really shows how violent and brutal Kratos is.,2021-10-15T19:29:38Z
MegMage,This is my favorite one!! You are going to have a blast meg,2021-10-15T16:25:00Z
MegMage,This is my favorite &quot;God of War game. I&#39;m excited to watch your entire playthrough. Thank you for taking your time to learn and just being an fun wonderful woman. Awesome video 🙌🏽,2021-10-25T09:26:41Z
MegMage,"Hi Meghan finally the time has come, your journey through GoW 3 begins and I am really looking forward to accompanying you. I don&#39;t want to talk too much either, I just look forward to reliving the story together with you and I have nothing more to say than have fun with the story and I&#39;m looking forward to exciting videos by and with you. My girlfriend and I wish you a nice weekend, a wonderful wedding and all the luck in the world for the three of you. Lovely greetings from Austria",2021-10-15T21:40:30Z
MegMage,So glad to see this play through starting! And don&#39;t you worry about people poking at you for being emotional Meg! I always appreciate you wearing it on your sleeve with games and having the same reactions I do watching at home! Onto Olympus!,2021-10-15T15:45:16Z
MegMage,"It&#39;s crazy how many powers Kratos had in the games and took it without giving it a second thought  he used it like a tool instead of something close to it.<br><br>Which I think made Kratos very versatile and crazy because even when he looses some of those abilities he&#39;s not saddened compared to some people losing their powers they become sad because they feel like they have a deep connection to having those powers they had, without them they feel useless and don&#39;t know what to do without it.",2022-09-09T22:02:43Z
MegMage,"Kratos has been through too much, he watched his brother be taken from Athena and Ares as a kid, grew up and became a spartan general, had to find Ambrosia (a cure for his daughter that was dying at the time), gave his life and servitude to Ares so that he wouldn’t die, slaughtered the innocent and deserving, slaughtered his family blindly, Had to watch his mother die and watch her turn into a monster and kill her, kill a evil mirror clone of himself, watch his brother die by the hands of death, officially die and come back to life, fight his way to travel back in time, fight Zeus back in time when he died, learn Zeus was his father, Kill his father, kills himself and comes back to life since he was cursed with how he can’t die from his own hand, wander the world for a new place to hide and just life stress free, has mental issues and can’t live with himself, end up north in Scandinavia and meet a woman, have a new child with her, she dies and the child grows up learning he’s a god (something Kratos didn’t want him to learn because he wanted to spare him the thought of him being a god and possibly relive the same life he did) and now having to fight a whole new pantheon because he is the one who started the Ragnarok prophecy early and rewrote history. I think this man deserves credit for needing a break",2022-05-18T08:09:17Z
MegMage,"Ssooooo well done in your debut!  There is strategy involved in this game, but us old heads playing back in the day were just like..... &quot;I&#39;m going to fuckinh destroy everything.......&quot; and we did.  Of course we didn&#39;t have much strategy or nuance at the time, but damn this game was just raw and kinda like get out if Kratos&#39; way, and that dynamic worked expertly in this game.<br><br>Thank you for sharing the game play with us as God know about other appointments and plans you have lined up, so let me just take a minute to say, &quot;Thank You, and I appreciate your effort and not forgetting about us in this very busy time for you!  <br><br>As far as gameplay goes..... it just gets even more epic from here.  Cool homages, great throwbacks for minigames and even a few homages shouted out to old vanquished foes (think original sea barge captain).  My only request is that you take a little time so advance through levels and bosses.  Thar way you don&#39;t miss anything and really understand some of the dialog between character.  In fact, there are probably about 7 or 8 lines from this game that get mentioned in God of War 2018.  Anyway.... sorry for the long post.  Tha k you for taking time to post during the time you have set aside for festivities and wedding celebrations. My absolute best to both you and Kaleb.  I&#39;m glad he found a kick ass woman in you and I&#39;m glad you found a kick ass person and support partner.  Makes me happy that I accide tally happened across your channel.  cheers 🍻 and beers and wine 🍷 to you both.  May all the days ahead for you both consist of a strong, steady breeze, and nothing but clear horizons.  I wish you both my very best!  Congrats 👏 👏 👏  to you both!",2021-10-16T10:38:37Z
MegMage,"you get a like from me for just playing this game. havent reached even 5 seconds into the video. Not shitting on GOW for PS4, but in my opinion this is a better game in terms of gameplay. and story is also really good just not presented in a movie style narrative like a lot of sony&#39;s new titles. i always prefer gameplay over storytelling as im playing videogames not watching movies. the rage that channels through to you from Kratos in this game is just amazing. The music is unparalled. The starting bit with the female voice narrating the story and then the intro music is something no game has ever come close to replicating except maybe MGS4 when &quot;best is yet to come&quot; starts playing after Snake dreams of the PS1 section gameplay.",2021-12-31T23:01:31Z

MegMage,"Killing gods has quite the dramatic consequences! Everyone is a bad guy in Greek Mythology, even Kratos. But Kratos is our baddie so it&#39;s cool. This game is so iconic for making a protagonist pretty much the bad guy, even if his motives are very good.<br><br>P.S. I don&#39;t mean to be pushy so I apologise but please tell me you&#39;re gonna play God of War 4 after this one, these games are great but the next one really is on a whole new level and easily one of the best story games ever made!

MegMage,I love how Atreus brings out empathy in Kratos.  It&#39;s not just a story of a father raising his son but how they teach each other . Kratos teaches self reliance and survival and Atreus teaches empathy and how to accept help from friends and allies when necessary.,2022-11-26T03:38:42Z
MegMage,"A fun fact: The story Mimir tells about a king from his homeland usurping the throne and all that, is actually a reference to the story Macbeth! However the way he tells it makes it seem like it actually happened in the God of War universe rather than a stage play; even Atreus says to write it down (and other stories he has) which I think references Mimir as potentially being this worlds Shakespeare lol.",2022-11-26T20:41:40Z

But Odin hung himself from the World Tree and stabbed himself letting the blood drip into the Well of Destiny. Killing himself so that he could enter Helheim. He stayed there for 9 days gaining as much knowledge as he could from the World Tree in Hel. Until the Tree got so feed up with him that it sent him back to the world of living, or &quot;spat him back&quot; as Mimir put it.",2022-11-26T23:29:20Z

In general, a few Things have been designed differently, but what is still just as great (as in every other GoW Game) is the great Mix of Gameplay-Story-Level Design-Characters and the excellent Soundtrack. In any case, Thanks Meg for another exciting Episode of GoW and I&#39;m really looking forward to the other Episodes to come. Until then I wish you a nice Friday, have Fun and lovely Greetings to You and your Loved ones <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2022-11-25T08:17:48Z
MegMage,I wouldnt say Ragnarok is boring... just not nearly as well written as 2018...,2022-11-26T18:02:22Z
MegMage,The game definitely looks fun and a good break from the highly emotional and heartbreaking games that you are currently playing.,2023-03-11T17:39:51Z
MegMage,"Hi Meg, I don&#39;t know if you will come across this comment but I just wanted to tell you that I&#39;ve discovered your channel few days ago. It caught my attention how seriously you are able to emerge yourself into a video game. I am watching your old playthroughs of Dragon Age and The Witcher and I am absolutely in love with the way you are playing. I am that kind of person who feels really attached to video game characters, (especially those from the games you play because I got raised on them). I&#39;ve been going through really difficult time for me, your videos are helping me with putting myself together, and hoping that things might turn out eventually into something better. Right now I am more or less forced to stay in toxic environment (I come from negative and abusive family). While I was watching your playthroughts I&#39;ve heard that you also are a victim of abuse (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s appropriate for me to write it here tho, I am sorry if I offended you). I just wanted to thank you for sharing your story and being as passionate about video games as you are, I am happy that I am not the only one who feels as much attachment to characters and the story as you do. It might sound silly but your positive and cheerful approach when you play helps me with becoming a more cheerful person myself, since I struggle with bad thoughts 99% of the time and I really don&#39;t know how to escape them.",2023-03-12T13:33:52Z
MegMage,"hey meg! love your videos, certainly didn&#39;t expect to see you play this game. might i suggest two others: &quot;hellblade: senua&#39;s sacrifice&quot; (since you mentioned mental health) and &quot;lost in random&quot; (because the artstyle is similar, if a bit more on the tim burton side)",2023-03-11T18:16:59Z
MegMage,Meg ever play Nier Automata? She would love it,2023-03-12T09:52:23Z
MegMage,Hey that&#39;s our game! &lt;3,2023-03-12T09:10:16Z
MegMage,When are you gonna play mafia 2?,2023-03-12T13:31:07Z
MegMage,I don’t know if I be concerned or laugh by the fact the dead guard is “Spear Dancing” 😅,2023-02-03T19:02:10Z
MegMage,This is the best fight scene i ever seen 😂,2023-02-03T19:20:51Z
MegMage,Ezio is certainly a thrusting experiment.,2023-02-03T21:30:48Z
MegMage,Wait... How is a brutal execution a sexy move?,2023-02-03T22:27:42Z
MegMage,"Having the hearts and the music just took it from intensely brutal, to hilarious.",2023-02-03T19:17:33Z
MegMage,I love your laugh! ❤,2023-02-06T17:18:26Z
MegMage,"You naughty girl, you got a dirty mind😂😂😂",2023-05-03T20:33:29Z
MegMage,😂😂😂,2023-02-05T12:35:57Z
MegMage,How do I find a girl like you? AC is my favorite game franchise. Been obsessed since before I should’ve played.,2023-02-03T19:58:46Z
MegMage,Damn,2023-02-04T04:50:34Z
MegMage,I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the best music choice,2023-02-05T05:53:06Z
MegMage,It&#39;s a halberd not a spear,2023-03-11T05:45:35Z
MegMage,Honestly the spiderman in this game is probably the best spidey so far. He&#39;s just written and voiced so well especially in the later parts of the game. Man I wasn&#39;t ready for the feels,2021-08-12T16:16:57Z
MegMage,"Fun facts: Spider-Man is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal while Yuri Watanabe is voiced by his wife Tara Platt. So here the husband is calling his wife by his own first name...<br><br>Also, MJ is voiced by Laura Bailey, while her husband, Travis Willingham, (both of whom are main cast members of one of the most successful web podcasts of all time: Critical Role) voices Wilson &quot;Kingpin&quot; Fisk.",2021-08-12T19:24:31Z
MegMage,The movement while fighting/exploring is so good in this,2021-08-12T16:12:01Z
MegMage,"I watched the animated Spider-Man series when i was VERY young. I remembered when Mr Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man 1st hit the theatre n i saw the big posters, i was like &quot;IS THIS REAL?! I got to see a REAL LIFE Spider-Man&quot;😱 i got SUPER EXCITED n i cnt described the feeling! That&#39;s the Spider-Man that i grew up watching n loving til now! Those were the days n it was such a sweet memories🥲 n now ur playing this AMAZING game in ur channel, what a BLESSING!😇",2021-08-12T16:16:08Z
MegMage,You have to use the the right stick more. It&#39;s a crucial part. It speeds up finding where you need to go if you look up down left right. Just a suggestion.  Enjoying the Playthrough. 👍 👍,2021-08-13T03:32:59Z
MegMage,"Yay Spider-Meg! I agree with you that the og face model for Peter was already very attractive and it was unnecessary to alter his face. No shade to Tom Holland who is also handsome, but the updated version just makes him look too young now. Also yes please to the marvel marvel reactions. That would be so much fun.",2021-08-12T23:35:45Z
MegMage,"I&#39;m already SO in love with this game! So excited to play it alongside you all. Now I&#39;m more interested in Marvel 👀 would anyone be interested in Marvel movie reaction vids? <br><br>Also, had to mute the first song for copyright reasons :( I think in the future I&#39;ll keep the music and sacrifice the copyright.",2021-08-12T16:01:48Z
MegMage,"As a Spidey fan, been waiting for you to play this!",2021-08-12T16:54:04Z
MegMage,"Spiderman time! and while I love certain spiderman movies a lot and the cartoons this game was really good at telling a story of a young adult spiderman just trying to live his life. Love it and all the characters,",2022-05-22T01:29:19Z
MegMage,Everyone loved this game for the same reason; The swinging mechanics,2021-08-12T20:41:43Z
MegMage,"One thing I enjoy doing with these circuit mini games is do them backwards. Start from the endpoint, and the last piece put down is where the circuit starts, and boom, it&#39;s fixed as soon as it starts.",2021-08-12T20:03:18Z
MegMage,Oh no it&#39;s Dr. Octagon. He can only be beat by doctor decagon,2021-08-12T18:40:01Z
MegMage,the spider pig reference unlocked memories I didn&#39;t even know I had 😂,2021-08-12T18:48:35Z
MegMage,&quot;Is that Doctor Octagon?&quot; <br>Omfg I literally wanna smash my head against the table xD,2021-08-13T00:52:04Z
MegMage,"I’m not gonna pretend to be a superfan - the game is solid - but I will say that the one exceptional thing about it is the dignity with which it treats the homeless. So much of media portrays the homeless as unclean comedy cartoon characters, but here they’re real people with real hopes and fears and ambitions.",2022-05-27T21:05:40Z
MegMage,Doctor Octagon had me rolling,2021-08-16T03:05:53Z
MegMage,"I wish Insomniac would do an origins story on this adaptation of Spider-Man because there’s a lot of history Peter talks about that we never get to see because this isn’t based on any Spider-Man comic, show or movie.",2022-06-09T18:16:21Z
MegMage,Spider-Man does not kill the bad guys he just knocks them out even if they are kicked off the top of a building they are webbed to the side of said building if you check and it depends on which universe you are in in Spider-Man Norman Osborn is Green Goblin but in The Amazing Spider-Man Norman&#39;s Son Harry Osborn is The Green Goblin,2023-01-23T19:56:39Z
MegMage,You’ll like it I hope you have fun playing it it’s a blast,2021-08-12T19:33:36Z
MegMage,Now this is something I wanna see,2021-08-12T21:44:14Z
MegMage,Walking (instead of dodging away) towards an enemy literally SHOOTING HER IN THE FACE: WhOoPs My BaD.,2022-10-11T07:06:02Z
MegMage,The Remastered version of this Game on the PS5 has a younger face for Peter Parker and  the younger face is the one used for Peter in Spider-Man Miles Morales,2023-01-23T19:43:59Z
MegMage,Love you gonna enjoy this journey with you,2021-08-12T16:03:22Z
MegMage,PS4 spiderman games is really awesome sometimes I use to play<br>Spider man Long time   that spider man <br>Is a good storyline and a awesome super villain is really amazing,2022-07-10T05:32:31Z
MegMage,Can&#39;t wait to see your reaction to J. Jonah &quot;Alex Jones&quot; Jameson&#39;s podcasts.,2021-08-12T20:29:19Z
MegMage,"This is a solid game. The combat leaves a bit to be desired at least compared to the batman games, where combat feels more fluid. Spider-Man&#39;s counter system is lackluster, but works more often than not. Amazing story and well developed characters even for new fans who never picked up a Spider-Man comic. Enjoy, I know I did!",2021-08-13T02:48:04Z
MegMage,I got the same black friday bundle. $200 bucks well-spent.,2021-08-12T23:10:11Z
MegMage,"They changed his face because Tom Holland was more popular and they wanted to bank on that. In doing so they made him look way younger than he is in this game, really hard to get into it when the face model looks, like 15, when he’s supposed to be 23 or 24.",2022-01-13T02:37:23Z
MegMage,Its like watching a Toddler discover TidePods. No Idea what to do but bruteforcing it into her mouth,2023-06-22T10:25:24Z

MegMage,"I mean...one of the options is Isabela. Who can say no to her, aesthetically?",2022-07-04T18:02:59Z
MegMage,When I saw this my train of thoughts just went like this &quot;Will Meg react to this? How will she react and how many &quot;heart attacks&quot; will she have before passing out?&quot; Are you gonna upload the whole video on YouTube?^^,2022-04-05T20:51:32Z

MegMage,I always killed the boy zombie in my playthroughs so it’s really interesting to see your choice of Kenny doing it and the caption still being “You helped Kenny”.<br>This choice almost feels more progressive in helping Kenny move forward from his trauma within the context of the world they’re living in rather than being overprotective about it.,2021-08-01T22:04:27Z

At first I used just the former, because the latter didn&#39;t exist yet. But with both, I used the former for the stolen stuff. It isn&#39;t  organized like the purse is.

alliebeemac,Lmao...i have had the same frustrations when playing this game...trying to search the pocket or neck but get the head...ugh.  Haven&#39;t gotten this far though.  Now I feel like re-installing,2019-05-26T03:49:07Z
alliebeemac,I thought you were going to rename this stream from homicide desk to vice deck that&#39;s what you said at the end of the homicide desk stream your going to start a new stream with a new desk,2019-05-24T22:18:28Z
alliebeemac,"allie try not to get involved with the politics bullshit it gets people to riled up. your better then that. I like watching you get into the games not the comments. and that fruit cup ben shapiro aint helping even though hes got some good points, hes just adding to the drama. anyways love you your vids are great!",2019-06-11T17:13:41Z

alliebeemac,"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!! I just wanna say I&#39;ve already watched through once, and this might be one of the best movie reactions/reviews I&#39;ve ever seen, and you know I&#39;m crazy for this kinda stuff. However I do love you and your content unconditionally soI might be slightly biased. Moving on to ranting along with a rewatch.<br>1- I would absolutely have watched entire separate videos for each movie, but you do an amazingly entertaining and satisfying summary review.<br>2- I get the necklace thing if it&#39;s very important to her and she wears it everywhere and wants it in the portrait because she wants it to be a part of her as a historical figure, but I don&#39;t think they ever show the necklace being important in the first film, and the necklace is probably a commercial product so there could be issues with that and the royal family seemingly endorsing that brand.<br>3- THE BLOG, OH MY GOD! Like I could see a blog being a cute bit of a way to connect with the people and humanize the royal, blah blah blah, eat the rich. BUT BABE, YOU&#39;RE A QUEEN. YEAH, THAT SHIZ HAS TO BE CENSORED AT THE VERY LEAST FOR SECURITY REASONS. And hell, stans get creepy and toxic over INFLUENCERS, let alone celebrities or ROYALTY who have an online presence. You make one wrong complain-y blog post and the next year could be people picketing outside your palace for Advisor #7 to be fired for being sexist to the queen, or worse she could literally start a war.<br>4- That crown.... first of all, bad design......... Second of all, Eat the Rich.<br>5- Oh, ye, last king was a HUUUUUUUGE piece of garbage, 10/10 agree with you there.<br>6- I do still like Khalessi more as a name than a character now, though I can&#39;t blame her for that writing dumpster fire. But hey! Great way for a Jo Schmoe to explain war crimes to their kid, maybe not a great name FOR THE FUTURE QUEEN OF A NATION, WHAT THE FUCK EMILY.<br>7- T H A N K   Y O U   M O T H E R<br>8- True... I love Simon, and like you say later, he did try to take the throne for the good of the nation, but still They hated this boy as a person 2 years ago, and he didn&#39;t seem fond of them either. 1 year later they&#39;re reluctantly chummy and 2 later and he&#39;s a part of the family inviting his girlfriend, the queen&#39;s bestie around?<br>9-This might be the one scene of good acting Melissa has, and it kind of ruins her characterization, because if she always acted stilted and unenthused and spoke without much flavor or passion, you could say &quot;Oh, well yeah, I know people like that, I guess&quot; but this shows that&#39;s not her personality. I assume something was going on with her actress, or the directing because obviously she can act and knows how to play the character but she utterly flops in other scenes.<br>10- YOU RIGHT! (seriously though you can&#39;t tell me the royal family doesn&#39;t have some 300 year old fir tree sacred crib.)<br>11- You can&#39;t &quot;The Knight Before Christmas&quot; Tease me like this.<br>12- Yeaaaaaaah, that treaty would just, not exist anymore.....<br>13- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh1IFFoN8bQ&amp;t=14m40s"">14:40</a> Yeah, I don&#39;t always want to be this person, but if another royal looked at me like this immediately upon meeting me, I&#39;d be expecting some sort of proposition in the coming days, if you catch my drift.... not be weirdly antagonized for some reason.<br>14- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh1IFFoN8bQ&amp;t=15m28s"">15:28</a> Okay, Amber is a dumbdumb for talking here when she doesn&#39;t even know what&#39;s supposed to be said, and she doesn&#39;t wait nearly long enough, BUT LIKE WHY DOES RICHARD NOT DO THE THING?! THIS IS SO CONTRIVED. AT LEAST SHOW US RICHARD BEING NERVOUS OR LOST FOR WORDS OR TRIPPING UP, TO GIVE SOME EXPLANATION OF WHY AMBER WOULD FEEL THE NEED TO STEP IN.<br>15- A.... Amber.... Put your leg on your knee...... Like I get it, I have to touch those kinds of slippers to get them on right, and it&#39;d probably be even harder and more uncomfy to walk in if your feet were swollen and sore from being 9 months preggers..... but like???? Why are you moaning and whimpering like this is some weird kinky walkytalky play???? Or like you&#39;re going into labour or something?? Just say &quot;Ugh, I can&#39;t get my slipper on.&quot;<br>16- &quot;Either queen&quot; okay but this kind of contradicts their reasoning later of why Ming wouldn&#39;t sign the treaty, because if Ty and Ming said &quot;Amber CAN&#39;T sign the treaty because Ming doesn&#39;t want to also do it&quot;..... that&#39;s kinda dickish. If they&#39;d explained it as &quot;Well, Ty and Ming decided only Ty would sign and thus it&#39;d be uncouth for you to sign it, and you really shouldn&#39;t as it&#39;d be kind of disrespectful of Ming&quot; that&#39;d make sense, but this line exists, and thus it implies Ty and Ming said this and therefore are dicks, which doesn&#39;t fit with later their characterization at all.<br>17- The blatant misdirect of Lynn being the only one who doesn&#39;t react. Have I said I love Lynn and they don&#39;t do her justice?? <b>Because I love Lynn and they don&#39;t do her justice....</b><br>18- Okay..... First of all.... Neither of them are disrupting the peace... So either both of them would have their firstborn cursed for not drafting a new treaty immediately (_witch_ I&#39;d like to argue would be stupid terms for a curse of this sort especially given there are no terms to lift the curse by continuing the peace and cursing one person who probably has ZERO weight in this decision is so dumb and not a good motive to keep the treaty but WHATEVER), or neither of them would because they aren&#39;t the ones keeping it from being signed, Little is and therefore his firstborn would probably be the one to be cursed in that case, especially considering the previous line says this spell was cast on CLAUDE and his family, and we can assume Jun and his family, so the current ruling families might not even be covered under the curse.  SECOND OF ALL, THE CURSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED BY WHOEVER KILLED CLAUDE, AS THEY DISRUPTED THE PEACE, ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS JUN, HIS WIFE, OR SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY. Third, why is anyone even entertaining this? Even if magic is a provably real thing in this world, which X to doubt since we&#39;ve heard nothing of it before, but hey, maybe it went extinct because..... magic was hereditary and the witch trials were &quot;successful&quot; even though I don&#39;t really think genetics would allow that to work but benefit of the doubt it did.... It literally says right there, no one even knows if it was cast... And all the above reasons I&#39;ve stated for why it probably wouldn&#39;t work. Come on.<br>19- I mean it was the dumbest possible motive ever, so I don&#39;t blame her for believing him instantly.... But why haven&#39;t they already started ransacking every room in the castle whether suspect or not?? I mean clearly people don&#39;t lock their doors, so the treaty could be hidden in people&#39;s rooms without them knowing.<br>20- PRINCESS ZOEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! ♥<br>21- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh1IFFoN8bQ&amp;t=27m51s"">27:51</a> Water-feature at a 9 month pregnant baby shower seems like just asking for trouble.<br>22- Yeah, that reveal of the issue with Ming signing and dealing with it is super unsatisfying.<br>23- I... love??? Ty and Ming?????? I love Ty and Ming. That&#39;s all. I just love them.<br>24-....... ONE Dude confirms this myth of haunted Dungeons??? WeeOoo WeeOoo... <br>25- Simon is cute. But also there&#39;s NO reason to believe he&#39;s the thief... MAYBE trying to sabotage Amber and Richard&#39;s rule, if he&#39;d even been shown to hold a grudge over not getting the throne, but he hasn&#39;t? He pretty much immediately hitched himself to their team once they became King and Queen, and has done nothing but help them and establish himself as a part of their family since. Which kinda doesn&#39;t make sense, but it does kinda clear him of having a motive here.<br>26- This bullseye scene is nonsense, and she doesn&#39;t faint quick enough to make it funny and coincidental, it ends up coming off as &quot;Amber can get a bullseye right before fainting!! Better than Ming without fainting!&quot; which is just... no, considering we haven&#39;t been shown any reason for that skill. C&#39;mon...<br>27- I love Ty and Ming.....<br>28- Richard&#39;s an idiot.<br>29- Emily is definitely getting an injury from that fall you can&#39;t pull a fast one on me movie...<br>30- Now see I would&#39;ve forgiven the nonsense of no one questioning ONE GUY claiming the myth is real and the dungeons are haunted..... if we got confirmation the dungeons were haunted.... Like they hear tortured moaning, and suddenly the door mysteriously unlocked and opened. At least distract us from your nonsense, Movie.....<br>31- I mean fuck the curse, there&#39;s LITERALLY a woman in labour and WE&#39;RE WASTING TIME EXPLAINING SOME CLUE BULLSHIT. Amber MUST be in agonizing pain right now...<br>32-..... Okay, very cute moment, love Ming, but I&#39;m guessing Ty gave her that?? Or her parents or siblings or in laws.....? Yet she&#39;s just gonna give it to Amber? Couldn&#39;t she order a new one and send it to her? The fuck? That&#39;s a big ass gift for someone you just met, did some shit go on we didn&#39;t get to see?<br>33- Sooooo, Amber only updates her blog on a weekly basis with cookie cutter &quot;love my subjects, doing stuff this week, new baby says hi&quot; statements? Good to know.... What a job.<br><br>Loved the video and would kill to see more!!! Hope the wedding was great!!!",2020-01-03T04:22:53Z

alliebeemac,"I would like to point out the fact that it&#39;s been 20 years since anybody could have a kid in the half life universe. That means most adults that survived the invasion are incapable of creating children. So that means only the people who grew up in this world are capable of having kids. The human population is probably extremely depleted at this point. Especially with many humans joining the combine overwatch in order to survive, and the seven hour war probably killing the majority of the population of earth. With all that said, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to ask people to consider having kids at the time. Especially if the Combine can eventually reactivate the Suppression Field.

The game was brutal at points.<br><br>These last few streams you&#39;ve shown me a glimpse into games I would read the title or description of and not even give a second look to when buying games and I love it! <br>Sorry for the long ass comment lmao.",2019-04-04T09:50:10Z

alliebeemac,"The reason the Nazis were probably so advanced in this time line is because they were. Kind of like the invention of the first rocket. The V1 V2 first war rockets that were already flying to the coast of Britain. That was unimaginable at the time. The Nazis and the German technicians consistently exceeded what was considered impossible with their technology. Which leads back to the work and perfectionist mentality of the Germans. Germany was called the land of poets and thinkers. That&#39;s really how it was known. I don&#39;t know why almost nobody knows about it anymore. But if you look at the inventions and poets of the Germans, you can see why. The first car, first computers, telephone, jet engine.<br><br>The simple reason why the Nazis have the atom bomb in this timeline is probably that the German scientists who invented the atom bomb in America had to stay in Germany. People like Albert Einstein. Thus, the Nazis were able to develop the atomic bomb first. To this day, historians are undecided on how close the Nazis got to the atomic bomb. In fact, the Nazis were close to development even WITHOUT the important scientists who then fled to America. But only in theory. The big problem was the resources. The Nazis fought against all major powers at the same time and therefore had no resources with which to build the atomic bomb. The resources, with the stupidity of Hitler and the high command, were ultimately the decisive point why the Third Reich fell. They had the strength, engineering and tactics. Strongest army in history. But Because of their own stupidity and greed, they fell. I wish Stauffenberg had made it...",2023-06-12T11:10:34Z

He is compassionate, has a complex inner life, is clearly traumatized and emotionally repressed by his time as a killer.<br><br>Plus he hates nazis, who are all about rigid and unhealthy masculinity, and are obsessed with shallow aesthetics. He makes a great symbol of rejecting their ideology. Rather than enforcing the values he was seemingly raised with, he wants something better and freer for the future.",2021-02-23T14:42:02Z

alliebeemac,"@alliebeemac: The reason why you where so confused at the ending after the epilogue, to why the narrator did not fix thing, it was because your suppose to bring the bucket to the new content door, so you have the bucket to the introduction of the jump circle you would understand what is going on and then bring the bucket to the new content door it would show return to stanley parable 2 exibit, and since the narrator did not relize you have the bucket their is a new ending by bringing the bucket too the reasurance bucket at this point do not exit throught the stairs because if you do the title will return back to 2, and you will missout on the new title screen and to fix it you have to go through the epilogue again.  You can return to the skip button after the epilogue, it is in the executive bathroom mirror, I do not know if bringing the bucket to the introduction of the stanley parable is required to unlock the return of does ending, or they where just added in after the update.",2023-02-13T01:50:23Z
alliebeemac,"@alliebeemac: ending that you miss that are part of the  original ending,  close the door at your office for an ending, this one as no bucket version,  look at room 417, close both hallway door  their is also a bucket version that is new.   Did you do the click the door 430 5 time if you did I don&#39;t remember, their is also a bucket version.   You miss answer the phone without the bucket in the dark room,  unplug the phone without the bucket in the dark room part of the original ending and one of the truth ending of the original ending and this is also the rest of the missing confusion ending that is missing,   unplug the phone with the bucket in the dark room for one of the truth ending to the stanley parable 2.  You miss out the window without bucket the yes option, you miss answer 434 phone without bucket part of the original they are 3 diffrent message and only one message gives you the box ending which is also in the original, you can answer 434 phone with the bucket for a new message involving the bucket but their is only one new message with bucket.  Heaven ending, some computer that stanley can&#39;t turn off one will show awaiting input, by doing input receive and begining the game it will change to a diffrent computer that you can&#39;t turn off, the 3rd time is in the boss receptionist desk, and the 5th and last input is Stanley computer that is part of the original ending, their is not bucket version since the door normal shut down they are a few instance where the door remain open so you can bring the bucket to heaven, you will just be holding a bucket in heaven nothing else is different.   Escape pod ending without the bucket go to the boss office, and step out of the double door office just before the door close interupting the narrator that stays in the boss office, the 428 door will be open and each floor you climb look out the window you will understand why the normal elevator does not go anywhere, once you reach the escape pod room walk strait into the darkness, because if you walk backward for some light you will miss the visual that is part of the original ending, doing it with the bucket will be new and that is the only way to have the bucket in the epilogue also if you do the escape pod ending with the bucket you will lose the bucket for one ending, and if you need the bucket right away just begin the game again to have a replacement bucket.  You miss the tap recorder ending with the bucket. In title 8 begin the game for a new ending.",2023-02-13T02:13:45Z

Its absolute bullshit and scummy of Sony to do that, but it is what it is. No one that has streamed it on twitch that I am aware of has had any issues.

alliebeemac,Omg I love this! Please continue this series you&#39;re making my twilight reread enjoyable so far but you haven&#39;t posted in such a long time. If not then I&#39;d recommend another book by stephenie meyer The Host. It 110% has better writing I almost can&#39;t believe it&#39;s written by the same author plus for whats it worth the plot is more interesting than twilight,2023-03-19T09:59:19Z

alliebeemac,"-The intro bit is unironically great. It&#39;s just good, I like it, it slaps. Send tweet.<br>-The acceptance my brain automatically had about you eating a whole ass lemon like an apple before realizing it was ungodly is downright unacceptable. <br>-The secondary intro is vee cozy.<br>-1/3 a bottle down, lets goooooooo.<br>-Two thoughts, Bella does sound like a normal teen, but also this sounds like a first draft so far.<br>-OKAY, HOW FUCKIN&#39; DARE YOU MAKE ME AWARE OF THE MUCH MORE INTERESTING TIMELINE WHERE BELLA FINDS OUT EDWARDS A VAMPIRE BECAUSE SHE TRIES TO KILL AND BURY HIM AND HE COMES THE FUCK BACK. <i>HOW DARE YOU!</i><br>-Charlie???? Not ramen??? Not instant mac and cheese??? Not spaghetti??? Not spaghettios or soup???? Not dino nuggies?? I pray to god this is just an assumption on Bella&#39;s part, bc otherwise how tf is he alive????<br>-HE DID WHAT WHEN WHO DID WHAT???<br>- <i>WHY HAVE PEOPLE BEEN SAYING THIS MAN IS A WHOLESOME DILF?! I WANT TO HURT HIM PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, AND MENTALLY.</i><br>-You&#39;re right about the texting thing and you should say it.<br>-I&#39;m distracted by the cute, comfy looking sweater.<br>-Love the critic about recognizing toxicity in media, and Bella&#39;s failure to. I am nourished, thank you, bestest tofu cube.<br>-No that is not gun safe. You shouldn&#39;t hang a gun on a belt on a coat rack period, it could fall and misfire.<br>-Pointing it out is still funny, Steph gets ONE point.<br>-NAH, DRAG HIM QUEEN. You don&#39;t get to complain if you expect other people to cook for you. You want better food, learn to make better food.<br>-I&#39;m going to fight him first.<br>-Realizing how bad Charlie is with vibe checks and hearing that he apparently CONGRATULATES A GUY ON SEXUALLY ASSAULTING HIS DAUGHTER, I&#39;m real concerned about the state this county might be in crime wise....<br>-Okay, Charlie might be a terrible father but he is a bicon and I&#39;m here for it.<br>-I&#39;M GONNA KILL THIS MAN.<br>-BELLA, WTF, SNOW IS PRETTY????<br>-It&#39;s a fucking miracle Bella has any friends. No one should like her.<br><del>She has no reason to suspect they&#39;re vampires yet right??? So the get is literally just either Steph forgetting Bella doesn&#39;t know, or Steph going way out of her way to point out &quot;GET GET</del> I DIDN&#39;T SAY EAT SEE???&quot;<br>-lol Allie, setting up an enemies to lovers plot for yourself, I see.<br>-Why he chatting her up if he&#39;s trying to stay tf away from her cause she smells tastey? Like I know he ate since last time, and I know the answer is &quot;Because he&#39;s physically a 17 year old dumbass and this is a cheesy romance novel&quot;, BUT STILL.<br>-Yeah physically being stuck as a teenager doesn&#39;t explain not figuring out in 100 years that including mind reading info in conversation is a no no.<br>-You assume too much of me and my high school to think I&#39;d know and/or remember these phases of cell division.<br><del>OKAY NOW HE&#39;S LITERALLY FLIRTING!! </del><i><del>EDWARD, YOU CAN&#39;T</del></i><i> AAAAAAAAAAH</i><br>-I mean I get going back to high school occasionally, since we&#39;re constantly learning new things about the world and updating curriculums, but like???? Why not go to college like 10 times in between??? You could get at least like 2 doctorates before going back to HS to see what&#39;s new. They could be getting actual knowledge they could use instead of just relearning the same shit every 4 years. Like the them being physically teens thing doesn&#39;t even work, because it&#39;s not like nobody goes through college at 17... There being 5 17 year old freshmen who never talk to anyone seems much stranger than someone starting college a year early or even someone getting their doctorate while looking like a 17 year old.<br>-I just realized, Bella hates non-sunny weather.... She.... She becomes a vampire. Edward knows this. Knows she hates rain and snow and clouds... Knows that&#39;s how they have to live... And really let&#39;s her do that. Oh my goooooooooood.<br>-Good characterization that he&#39;s dumb! Bad continuity that he is later said to not be dumb!<br>-Babe, I&#39;m a grown ass adult and I&#39;d love someone to call me the fuck out like that now, I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s generic drivel. Like, YES, read me, you basic bitch.<br>-Drag Mike, Bella, fucking drag him. No mercy. Don&#39;t dim your shine for people who assume you dull.<br>-&quot;my team ducked out of the way&quot; Since????? When does tennis ever have teams of more than 2??? And why are they in front of her as she&#39;s serving????? And how do several pairs/groups of teens play multiple games of tennis in the gym of a small town HS???? I&#39;m pretty sure they made this volley ball in the movie, which seems to be what Stephanie intended to be writing about unless you misread something. lol But as a writer I could imagine changing which sport they&#39;re playing and forgetting to change everything. I&#39;m confused how no one caught that at any point during the writing or publishing processes though.....<br><del>WHY WOULD HE LAUGH</del> Okay, fine. FINE. I hate this.<br><br>I loved it!

alliebeemac,"You were wondering how long had elapsed between games in the Uncharted series, and in particular (I think) how long from Uncharted 3 to Uncharted 4? At one point I played through the entire remastered series as well as U4, making notes when I found clues. It&#39;s a bit long but here goes:<br>&quot;The backstory for Elena and Nate, between the end of Uncharted one and their encounter in Uncharted 2, can be found in Drake&#39;s U2 journal. Start by looking below Elena&#39;s picture (and the flower) to find &quot;Elena F.  / Papua Jul 2006&quot;, with a presumably fake phone number: (720) 526-192. <br><br>Revelatory details - like other dates and places in Nate&#39;s journal - tell a story: Chloe is on the same journal page as Nate&#39;s other significant others, including a Cassandra S. - obviously not Nate&#39;s mother, who was Cassandra Morgan, but interesting in the light of U4. Looks like Chloe Frazer was in Tulsa in 2002; and she, like all Nate&#39;s girlfriends, had a flower pressed to the page, even though she&#39;s not a flowers and chocolates kind of girl. (Nate, you are such a cad. But Elena had the freshest yellow bloom.)<br><br>People don&#39;t seem to realize it but tracing the entire Uncharted timeline can be done with morsels like that. For example: The last date I found was the wall calendar hanging behind Nathan in Jamieson&#39;s office, at the end of Uncharted 4. It shows that last scene was in November 2015, about when the game was released; and if daughter Cassie is around 12, that places the epilogue of U4 around 2028. (Elena sure had a long-lived Playstation 1, still running with no bit-rot.) Those journals tells all sorts of little stories for those with the patience to look. <br><br>Generally, the games are set in in the year of release. Compare again in Uncharted 2 above where Nate is leafing through his journal - you can see one Nepal visa was issued 29 November 2008 for fifteen days (till 13 December 2008), that he departed 6th December 2008, subsequently went to Indonesia with a visa dated 2009, then wound up again in Nepal at game time in June 2009, that is, 06/09 - as seen on the credit card receipt issued to the Kathmandu medical centre. It mentions AMS and explosive diarrhoea. (Poor Nathan!)",2018-07-14T10:49:00Z

It&#39;s heavily implied that Cole grew emotionally distant to his wife after the war. As it turns out, he never opened up to her. It&#39;s also worth it to give him a bit of a break for that line. He&#39;s been through the war, he&#39;s come across pedophiles, murderers, rapists. He&#39;s seen the incompetency and the corruption of the LAPD. He&#39;s been in Mason&#39;s bloody catacombs for god&#39;s sake. All of that is guaranteed to make a dent on his mental well-being.",2019-10-27T17:50:04Z

alliebeemac,"I dunno why people kept trying to &#39;confirm&#39; the age of the characters when they&#39;re born seeing as it&#39;s never actually officially confirmed, lol. They could be anywhere in the 9-13 range, it&#39;s never explicitly said because they don&#39;t have a point of comparison. But yes, it&#39;s such a breath of fresh air to go from INCREDIBLY over-sexualized anime shit in 2 to a game where the characters don&#39;t even know what sex is lmao",2022-08-25T06:44:15Z

alliebeemac,Honestly really lame you skipped 2 not even giving it a chance. Already missing out even now at the start of the game with no connection to vandham at all. Cant imagine how the later half of the game will be for you.,2022-11-11T01:52:35Z
alliebeemac,"If you are under impression that Tora was lusting over Poppi for the whole game, that is not true. There&#39;s one cutscene at the beginning that implies he&#39;s into maid outfits (with no assumptions made whether it&#39;s a fetish or he just finds them cute) and a pair of heart-to-hearts which make a lot of people cringe understandably, but their relationship is very tame.<br>I hope you decide to give the game a fair shake at some point, because people tend to overexaggerate how much impact the fanservice actually has on the game.<br>Of course if you feel like the character designs will keep you distracted throughout the game and the very ecistence of Tora is insulting it&#39;s probably best to not push yourself.<br>Best of luck with Xenoblade 3! I find parts of it flawed storywise when compared to 1 and 2, but it&#39;s an incredible game and parts that work well work REALLY well.",2022-08-25T08:03:52Z

Luckily it&#39;s only a few seconds and it only happens the once,  but I wanted to apologize for it anyway. Thanks for bearing with me &lt;3 And thank you for going on this journey with me as well. I know you all care about Clem as much as I do. Let&#39;s hope that this is a finale worthy of her ☺",2019-03-26T20:46:57Z

alliebeemac,"The bits  of dialogue where 3 scientists talk about a scientific study that inspired one of them to pursue a career in science and is something they’re attempting to reproduce to prove something or other, was actually a bit of meta humour since Black Mesa is a remake/ reimaging of the original Half Life, which was an inspiration to many young gamers when it came out, and therefore Black Mesa is being referred to as the reproduction, however as anyone who has played it knows, it’s much more than that.",2020-03-26T00:27:46Z

JazzyGuns,Here it is guys... we’ve been waiting a long time for this 😭,2020-06-19T18:36:13Z
JazzyGuns,"This game is a masterpiece. People keep saying Joel deserved better. Did he really?! Joel was never heroic. We rationalized his actions in the first game and created a hero’s mythology for him because that’s the nature of video games. That hospital scene at the end of Part 1 was an act of pure evil. No matter how you cut it. That was the moment Joel went from lovable father figure willing to do anything to protect his “daughter” and the memory of his biological daughter to a villain. And the fact that Ellie reveals in Part 2 that SHE ACTUALLY WANTED TO DIE, makes it even worse. In video games the quest is usually to “save the world”. In The Last of Us Part 1 we ended up realizing we played as a character who at the end stop the world from being saved in a selfish act (that we admittedly empathized with because we experienced the heartbreak of Joel losing his daughter and the incredible bond he developed with Ellie. That STILL doesn’t justify what he did. Not only did he murder a slew of innocent people, HE STOPPED THE WORLD FROM BEING SAVED. <br><br>It turned the entire video game medium on its ears. Brilliantly. And words can’t describe how genius it was for Naughty Dog to give players the “choice” to shoot the doctor or not at the end. I always thought that was ingenious. Man oh man The Last of Part 2 let’s us see just how GENIUS it was. Violence begets violence, karma is cyclical, and no good deed goes unpunished. Whether we “like” it or not Joel had it coming. As does most characters in this shitty world of human depravity where THERE ARE NO HEROES. The amount of emotion Naughty Dog was able to illicit from me with The Last of Us Part 2 is some sort of artistic miracle. Pure magic and serenity turns into pure disgust and hatred in seconds in this universe and they balance that dichotomy beautifully. When I first got control of Abby after she killed Joel I wanted to throw my controller at the TV screen. But one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. ESPECIALLY in this universe. Who’s to say Abby’s revenge wasn’t just as justified as Joel’s or Ellie’s? In a world this bleak, anything goes. The key to making Abby’s character work was she was actually the FIRST character to realize the destruction her actions was causing and decided to break the cycle. So by the end of the game I loved Abby’s character and wanted her to find peace just as much as Ellie. The fact that they pulled that off is astonishing. I love her relationship with Owen and the Aquarium sequence was an ingenious set piece that they used to perfection. That being said, they used those moments of serenity against us because the moment they made us have a “boss fight” with Ellie as the villain and forced us to choke her out is one of the most gut-wrenching sequences Ive ever witnessed. In a game of movie. First time in my life I was “scared” to press a button on the controller. I didn’t want any part of it. AND THATS THE POINT. The Last of Us Part 2 is the greatest deconstruction of violence and it’s consequences ever made. In any medium. Period.",2020-06-22T02:30:37Z

JazzyGuns,"Fun fact: When the games were originally released on the GBA in Japan, this case didn&#39;t exist. It was created when the games were ported to the DS specifically to take advantage of the system&#39;s hardware, like using the touch screen for the Luminol testing, mic for blowing off the fingerprint powder, and 3D rendering for examining evidence and the security footage.<br><br>It also has a few references for stuff that appears in future games",2022-09-16T16:44:58Z

JazzyGuns,Jazz: “why does he sound like that?”<br>😂😂😂,2022-09-15T20:16:24Z
JazzyGuns,Pretty sure this is the longest case out of the whole ace attorney trilogy. I think this case was added to the first game after the other two games came out to celebrate ace attornyes launch on the DS,2022-09-15T20:17:55Z
JazzyGuns,The beginning tho😭😭😭,2022-09-15T20:01:25Z

JazzyGuns,So glad it&#39;s back!<br><br>This is one of my favorite cases in the entire series!,2022-09-16T21:21:08Z
JazzyGuns,Fun fact: the screw driver from the AI 16 case is from the 2nd case of ace attorney  that April May was covering up for the Wire tap. Edgeworth doesn&#39;t mention it to Phoenix because it will probably hurt both of them since Mia died and Phoenix had to defend Maya and a Edgeworth was very ruthless and now regrets being like that.,2022-09-17T21:06:45Z
JazzyGuns,"The fact you are playing Phoenix Wright and masterfully knocking it out of park, makes me want to get this game as well Jazzy! Great stuff!",2022-10-05T15:59:28Z

JazzyGuns,"Jazz! If you like these type of murder-mystery investigation games, I recommend a game called Paradise Killer. It’s way more interactive, the characters are interesting to talk to, you can draw your own conclusions in the trials, not to mention the games overall aesthetic is gorgeous 😂 imo it’s definitely worth looking at",2022-09-16T01:23:54Z

JazzyGuns,Just started watching but thank you for that intro. This section of the game had me dead .  Love the savage talk,2022-08-02T01:47:19Z
JazzyGuns,"Hey Jazz! Just little tips for you in this game: no need to get the switchboard operator to shut down phones if you only start shooting inside the territory of the enemy. They only call for the police if you start shooting up the streets lol. Also, you need to punch the snitches to stop them because shooting them will only cause more snitches to pop up. Another things is that the dialogue of the three underbosses in the sit-down is affected by who gets assigned to lock down that specific area on the map (one or two people will express interest in the area if you called them to move in on a half of the place). Love watching your videos, always stay safe &lt;3 !",2022-08-03T08:06:21Z

JazzyGuns,"Nolan North voices Remy Duvall and Nathan Drake. Probably sucks for him that they made Remy Duvall look so much like him, and not Drake. I know I&#39;d much prefer a racist character to not look anything like me irl",2022-08-01T20:22:50Z
JazzyGuns,Hard to believe that Remy is voiced by the same person who voiced Nathan Drake,2022-08-01T20:17:28Z

JazzyGuns,"That Chair moment was priceless Jazz 😂<br><br>However Imma set the record straight, you need better control over your mods no joke. Demanding for member exclusive chat when many of us aren’t member/still love communicating. Also when toxic behavior happens, it seems none of them would be on board half of the time to help out they deadass be going ghost (hell even encourages bad behavior like example that one fan Of Christine Rainbow with the chat bullying her). You just need new mods girl<br><br><br>(Edit) She announce on Twitter that’s she looking for new mods. For the ones doing there job good for you however a lot of you haven’t been productive at all. She definitely need new staffs",2020-12-18T02:04:43Z

JazzyGuns,"The break up thing isn&#39;t our business however...yall (people in the comments) act like you cant simple answer questions. Clearly Im looking in the live chat and seeing people comment &quot;omg they broke up&quot; So it is 100% okay to ask what happened (as in &quot;why is everyone saying this&quot;)  especially if you are not in the loop on twitter or whatever. Yall making it seem like people are asking why they broke up. They are just asking if it is real. Thats it. Remember for most of us, we found them from their COUPLE channel. The channel that was branded as a COUPLE channel. Why they broke up is not our business I agree. However its not wrong for longtime fans of this COUPLE  to ask if it was a real break up or not. Idk about you but Im subscribed to Dwayne N Jazz and then I found out about JazzyGuns and the Dwayne Kyng Channels.",2020-12-18T02:49:20Z

JazzyGuns,I am born and raised in New Orleans. For this game to legit have key landmarks and different parts in New Orleans is crazy. That amusement in mafia 3 is basically the abandoned Six Flags in New Orleans. Its covered by trees and probably in a swamp too.,2022-05-10T22:27:28Z

LDShadowLady,Here&#39;s a hint for cat breeding:<br><br>What ever cat you give the fish to first is the design of the kitten you will get.<br><br>For Example:<br>Siamese + Ginger = Siamese <br>Ginger + Siamese = Ginger <br>Siamese + Tuxedo = Siamese <br>Tuxedo + Siamese = Tuxedo <br>Ginger + Tuxedo = Ginger <br>Tuxedo + Ginger = Tuxedo,2017-09-04T13:45:22Z
LDShadowLady,You make me so happy Lizzie. Thanks for making your channel 💖,2018-12-03T23:19:41Z

LDShadowLady,Wow Moonlights’s voice was deeper than I expected,2021-01-09T11:08:06Z
LDShadowLady,"Lizzie I have a perfect idea. You and everyone else on the server should write a will so that if you did, you can leave things like your shop and resources to people that are still alive! You could have people complete a quiz or something and get the right to the shop or some of your stuff. That way, they get some stuff but have to work for it.<br><br>Edit: OMG I can&#39;t believe I actually got one like, let alone five! Thank you!<br>Second Edit: OMG I can&#39;t believe so many people liked it!",2017-09-04T15:15:43Z

LDShadowLady,I love how Lizzie&#39;s videos are so positive and pretty and she takes lots of time to do some good editing and getting things like name tags on her own time to make the videos more entertaining and enjoyable to all viewers because she is kid friendly and whenever i am having a bad day or am sad i watch some of Lizzie&#39;s videos and she makes me laugh and smile!<br>Thank you Lizzie!,2017-09-04T04:00:42Z

LDShadowLady,"I think the Traps are a good idea but I think you should make it so its easier for you to avoid them. Trespassers shouldnt know where they are but make it so you can easily go around them, like maybe you could atleast try using a side door. We are all concered for your safety. So that why you can live on the edge without getting pushed off it XD",2017-09-03T20:29:55Z

LDShadowLady,I love every single one of LD Shadow Lady’s videos,2022-05-28T05:21:53Z

You didn&#39;t show my favourite bit... check out the wheat growing! They&#39;re fantastic! :D<br><br>I remember a quick competition cooking mini-game you played a while ago Lizzy, and this pack would be just right for that. :)",2014-03-15T01:04:47Z

GamerGirl,Hey Karina!* My little sister watches your videos on YouTube kids and while she’s watching she calls you her friend and talks with you while doing commentary 🤣 so I was wondering if you’d want to play with her not on recording but just in blank she’s staring pre-k and she’s very nervous and watching you makes her feel better. (She is 4) it would mean the world if you did this ❤️✨,2020-09-07T13:52:05Z

GamerGirl,♒♒Hi Karina I see that you are a bit confused on Japaneese/Chineese or other language but it&#39;s very very simple if you need to type or do anything like sending a message etc then all you need to do is go to Google and search Google Translate Put the first one to English and the second one to the language u wanna translate suppose Chineese then you have to copy it and paste it in the apps♒♒Also if you wanna use emojis then you can press ctrl and period (&gt;) I hope this helps you understand ♒♒,2020-12-01T13:29:57Z

GamerGirl,"(Common tasks mean all the crewmates have them)<br>Tip: Common tasks are (card swipe and wires) so if the common task are on 1 then see which common task u got. So if u got wires then whoever goes to admin and does card swipe is the imposter bc it’s only 1 common task and if he was to have it then u should, u don’t got it so it’s him. Another example if u got card swipe and not wires then whoever does wires is the imposter bc u don’t got that common task and he do. <br>Hope this helps👍",2020-11-29T21:01:41Z

stacyplays,Stacy on 90th episode or 100th episode of mystic mesa. Do an 2-3 hrs long. Do a livestream here on youtube so while you&#39;re playing we/viewers can give you tips or ideas while you&#39;re playing.,2017-08-18T02:42:31Z
stacyplays,some breeding tips i have learned are if you breed a normal unicorn with a destrier pegasus(with the destrier texture)(sycamore) you will get a giant red wing blackbird (there are images on the wings horns and hooves website) and if you breed a normal pegasus(pogonip) with a destrier horse with the hippocampus texture(no tail) ( seaweed but giant) you will get a giant blue belle (also showcased on the wings horns and hooves website) (the blue belle is also available in hippocampus form if you use a giant hippocamp pegasus) hope this helps,2017-08-18T02:46:57Z

Also, you can turn leather armour into camouflaging armour, unfortunately you have to kill chameleons!! Hi guys, this is all for Mystic Mesa!I have a solution for benji, since he can&#39;t walk around without teleporting him you could lead him to a fence! That way he gets his exercise but doesn&#39;t leave home!! Also, make sure you check on all your animals!! Maybe you could have a day where you look for eggs!! Here are some cool names too!! <br>Twilight- it has  to be on a unicorn, then it will change colour!! <br>Dinnerbone- will make any animal go upside down!! <br>jeb_- naming a sheep jeb_ will make them rainbow!!<br>Toast- if you name a bunny toast it turns to this cool texture!!<br>Sorry this was long but please like so Stacy can see!! Luv ya stac!!",2017-08-21T02:12:00Z

If you want to slow down with the cheetah, you can just shift (in fact you&#39;re so fast that shifting should be like running/walking). Your nether wolf is dying, you should heal it! (you can use a healing potion too i think). You have to right click your furnace pet in order to make it work! Some pets work like that, it&#39;s written in their description box when you scroll over them. I think that&#39;s about it, I hope you see this and I hope it was useful!

I swear the fifty some-odd tabs open in my browser at a time thing has nothing to do with my computer being shiddy. It&#39;s not my fault, I blame Twitch. It handles YT just fine. Hold on, my computer just caught on fire again... it&#39;ll be fine after I douse it with... something... just got my cold coffee out of the microwave... guess that&#39;ll do.

Dexbonus,PET ADVICE: Normaly its the cat that has issues with the dog. If your cat is used to being held the best way to get them used to eachother is to hold your cat and pet him while letting him smell the dog. If your cat is too scetchy just hold the dog so it CAN NOT make eye contact with your cat and let the cat smell the dog. You have to do this over and over like perhaps 10 times before your cat will relax. Once the dog is gone give your cat extra love so he knows he did a good job.,2012-12-13T08:31:00Z

Most other vegetables I prefer well cooked.",2012-12-13T08:13:38Z

Dexbonus,"I know that feel bro, but I have a thing that might make your un-healthy obsession a good thing. Wait a few days, if possible, without watching Dodger&#39;s videos. Then when you have the urge to watch them again or have something that you want/need to do (drawing, homework, work, cleaning) just start up your iPod or phone and listen to the video while you do what you do. I&#39;ve gotten lots done this way. Actually, Dodger, if you read this, thanks! I&#39;ve gotten a lot do thanks to you! :D",2012-11-05T03:59:08Z
Dexbonus,"When I was a young boy, I had an obsession with swiping sticky tack from the stuff hung up on the walls of my elementary school. My addiction got so bad that one time, when my 1st grade teacher went to walk the kids down to the buses (I got picked up), I went in her desk and swiped a chunk of her sticky tack ball. I slowly accumulated sticky tack over the years until I had a ball of my own, the size of my thumb. I still have it. That was about 15 years ago. I guard it with my life.",2012-10-29T19:18:29Z
Dexbonus,"I had much of the same feeling this weekend except it wasn&#39;t for The Goon, but for Sword Art Online. There is just something about fully engrossing one self into a story/setting/world, where when i&#39;m watching the episode or reading exerts; I forget the world i am living in and living all the great moments that are experienced by the characters.

Dexbonus,"If you are on a comic blast, you should definitely check out Locke &amp; Key. Its written by Joe Hill (son of Stephen King) and is epic (if a little dark). 
I got back into comics after using the Comixlogy app on the iPad and using Comics as a tool to entice my son into reading. Once he started reading I started to get back into comics myself and checking out what else was out there. I ended up consuming all there was on Locke and Key within a few days.....its that good!!",2012-10-29T05:50:11Z
Dexbonus,"My cat hates tacks too, i use the sticky tack but i hang smaller lighter pictures and posters, also I agree with your view on The Matrix trilogy. I love the first one, yes the other two are a little cheesy, but it all rounds out and creates a really great story. Unfortunately most people don&#39;t feel this way.",2012-10-29T09:54:31Z
Dexbonus,"Yes! I&#39;m super glad you love &quot;Saga&quot; because it&#39;s my favourite series right now. You should check out the seventh issue when it comes out in November (I think it&#39;s the second Wednesday it comes out?). You should also check out &quot;The Manhattan Projects&quot; vol. 1 by Jonathan Hickman and Nick Pitarra as well as &quot;American Vampire&quot; by Scott Snyder and Raf Albuquerque. You also might like the newest &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; series by Marvel with Carol Danvers as CM, it&#39;s been pretty badass so far. All the comics!",2012-10-29T08:26:44Z

Dexbonus,So I was browsing reddit and saw this particular thread teaching a very valuable lesson on how to do a loud whistle. Sure I can do the gentle melodic whistle along with Axl when listening to Patience but if I ever need to step up my game and get the attention of a ragtag group of survivors in a zombie apocalypse I&#39;d need the skill to do so.

Dexbonus,"Hey Dodge, i am a huge comicbook nerd. i read A LOT of stuff.

if you were interested, i would highly recommend checking out Rick Remenders Uncanny XForce from Marvel. In my opinion its been the best Marvel series this past year. but to help sell you on it, wolverine and deadpool are on the team with a few other peeps, it&#39;s killer.

Also the new Hawkeye series has been really amazing. Reads a lot like an indie book rather than a super hero. the art is very 70&#39;s pop art style",2012-10-29T05:37:53Z

The world is burning down, and the economy isn&#39;t looking up for my generation, nor are prospects appreciating in general. Statistically, we will live to see another major war in our lifetime.

It&#39;s like if Bill Gates came up to you and was like &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about money; you are rich in friendship.&quot;

When I was younger I did try to fit in to the &quot;ideal&quot; but it drove me crazy. Being confident is doable but hard as hell when you hear no positive comments. But there really is no &quot;ideal&quot; attractive body type. Hell, I&#39;m straight, but I think I have a (slightly?) bigger than normal mancrush on Jesse. My brain confuses me sometimes.

I still think of myself as ugly in my own standards and by society standards, but I&#39;ve learned that beauty is a subjective matter.

Example: I dont think Olivia Wilde is sexy &#39;cuz she looks like my ex and she was insane crazy.

Sqaishey Quack,Hey,2022-09-22T17:05:16Z
Sqaishey Quack,"Great video Sqaishey! I love the idea if turning the mob spawner into a tree, it will fit in a lot more. Just a suggestion, but I think sometimes things look better unsymmetrical, just because most naturally slawned things aren&#39;t. But nevertheless it still looks great. The squids are loving your water, maybe they want to be added to the Feather Friends ping. Or maybe they are stealing your pumpkin pie! Also for the Things For Today chest I recommend putting double what you think you need in, so if you do want to build anything extra you have the right amount of materials to do so.  Sometimes when playing in survival I wish I could fly, its so annoying having to build platforms, its like leaving a trail of dirt behind me 😂 Also, is your server going to open again anytime soon? I miss playing on it, even if it can get quite hectic at times. Anyway as I said before, great video Sqaishey. Thanks for uploading!",2015-05-02T21:50:36Z

Sqaishey Quack,"Sqaishey, tip when crafting. Hold right click and drag to put one of the item in the spaces you drag over. Hold left click and drag to put equal amounts in slots you drag over. This also works for chests and your inventory. To put all stacks of cobble or whatever into a chest, double click the stack/item to put all stacks in chest. Works vice-versa.<br>Hope this helps you Sqaishey!",2015-05-02T12:54:29Z

KittyKatGaming,"One time on the first mission, I had this guard in a headlock and I was getting clues. When I was done I accidentally let him go, so I panicked and pressed random buttons, and snake grabbed the guy, lifted him up in the air by his head, and slam dunked his head into the concrete, leaving cracks from the impact. (insert John Cena meme here)",2015-11-06T03:43:39Z

KittyKatGaming,"Fun fact: Digoxin is used to treat certain heart conditions. It would have slowed Ahab&#39;s heart rate and killed him due to the fact that his heart was already weak from being in a nine year long coma. Therefore, it was probably something more along the lines of adrenaline mixed with steroids to help his muscles.",2017-07-12T07:11:15Z

KittyKatGaming,I like the effect on the screen when your badly wounded... It&#39;s supposed to resemble a film strip being burned... (Random fun fact) Kojima was once toying with the idea of having a fuzzy 80&#39;s movie filter in Phantom Pain... That would have been really interesting!,2015-10-29T20:04:37Z
KittyKatGaming,Holy shit combine their two codenames and you get the one I got! Laughing Salamander! Awesome! Or not because Arin changed it to Decoy Shark,2015-11-06T18:25:55Z

Its permanent suppressor is only accessible at level 6, and earlier versions without it heavily resemble the AMT Auto Mag Pistol with the addition of a polymer frame. The gun is the equivalent of the XM9 from MGS2, Mk.22 Mod 0 featured in MGS3, Portable Ops &amp; Peace Walker, and the Ruger Mk. II from MGS4, and as in those games is manually operated. An unsuppressed, golden version is available with the Collector&#39;s Edition of the game.",2015-10-30T02:19:52Z

KittyKatGaming,these intros are just the best,2015-10-29T17:17:02Z
KittyKatGaming,"I wish arin would make his own show based on his parody of kaz and Ocelot. Those are my favorite parts of this playthrough and Suzy&#39;s gay side story adds to it. I mean, rick and Morty is based off of Justin Roiland&#39;s extreme parody of back to the future, jsut imagine if Arin made a parody of Metal Gear Awesome that only sort of paid homage to the game but used his parodies of big boss, kaz and ocelot from this playthrough. I can already see him doing another version of &quot;It&#39;s Dangerous To Go Alone&quot; with Kaz trying to solicit big boss for sex through music. I&#39;d pay to see that on Adult Swim.",2015-10-30T04:12:14Z

KittyKatGaming,I believe taking Mercy’s invulnerability will using rez was a mistake. It’s definitely a lot harder to keep your team active and competitive in the heat of battle because of it and it can get a bit disheartening if you’re unable to help your team as a support hero. :( I hope Blizzard either gives back her invulnerability or creates something that can even everything out a little more..,2017-09-28T18:30:08Z

KittyKatGaming,"You&#39;re supposed to use food on enemy Yo-kai to make it more likely for them to befriend you. It helps to give them food that they like. I&#39;m surprised that Noway joined up so easily. I gave him his favorite food, ramen, several times and he would not join up. Once you do get Noway he is useful. He&#39;s a defensive tank who can draw enemy attacks to himself while raising his own defenses.",2016-01-06T23:42:52Z

KittyKatGaming,"Girl. You are gorgeous, and I LOVE this game so  muchhh! &lt;3",2015-07-13T22:10:20Z
KittyKatGaming,"The point of the salon is because unlike real life dating, in this game its better to have your client change appearence to match what their date likes, it helps them work out better and you won&#39;t have to lie on dates as much",2015-07-13T19:59:38Z
KittyKatGaming,You can change looks before a date so that you can match with the other person&#39;s preferences,2015-07-13T18:19:00Z

KittyKatGaming,"Changing their appearence on the first date just might make them more appealing to the other person. Say your cliant has blonde hair, but their best match likes brown hair- you can then change your cliant&#39;s hair color to give them a better chance of appealing to their match.",2015-07-24T06:21:04Z
KittyKatGaming,"You know Suzy, you only upload 5 days of the week, and only one video on each day. Because of that, I think you should make the videos longer than 10 minutes. If each one was at least 15 minutes or longer, I wouldn&#39;t feel like I didn&#39;t get my full fix of KKG.",2015-07-13T20:32:19Z

KittyKatGaming,This game doesn&#39;t take itself seriously at all. The salon isn&#39;t a complex social commentary about changing who you are to make others happy. It&#39;s a game mechanic you can use so their hair color matches their date&#39;s preference to grab some bonus points.,2015-07-13T21:38:41Z

KittyKatGaming,bastion is def singing here comes the bride. first bastion skin i’ve understood immediately ahaha. also you can get the scion skin bc they’re all unlockable for this event.,2018-06-01T00:59:40Z

KittyKatGaming,"Pharah-syndrome = when it feels like a hero hasn&#39;t got new skins for a while (you know, beside ASP and Qinglong) or has never enough new skins regardless of the actual reality. Reason: projecting other things to this feeling, like the lack of an animated short (she has a comic though), or sticking to the past when the hero didn&#39;t get skins as often as some of the more popular ones (while still getting more stuff than some of the others). <br><br>Tracer-syndrome = when it feels like a hero always gets new skins (or has more skins than anyone else) regardless of the actual reality. Reason: overexposure and temporary peaks of the hero&#39;s skin-releases (notice: her last event-legendary was actually Graffiti from Anniversary 2017).<br><br>Invisible Mei-syndrome = when people don&#39;t complain or notice hero&#39;s unbalanced and excessive supply in terms of cosmetic updates (has more legendary-skins than Tracer) or game modes (has 2 own festive game modes based around her), or other content like comics or animated shorts. Reason: Mei is bae (and constantly off-meta and has a low pick-rate making her invisible but mostly because Mei is bae)",2018-06-01T06:41:20Z
KittyKatGaming,Could Moira&#39;s &quot;This is a triumph&quot; voice line be a possible reference to Portal? GlaDos says that in the ending song &quot;Still Alive&quot;,2018-05-31T19:57:22Z
KittyKatGaming,"I feel like, they should add a &quot;mech&quot; &quot;no mech&quot; option to dva&#39;s emotes.",2018-06-01T16:44:07Z
KittyKatGaming,Definitely 2nd year. I remember everyone being excited for it to come out in 2016 when I was working for Google,2018-06-01T04:05:14Z

KittyKatGaming,I was just disappointed with Moira&#39;s dance because they missed a perfect opportunity to give her an Irish dance and a matching skin. How awesome would that have been?,2018-05-31T20:40:10Z
KittyKatGaming,That mccree quote is directly from a Sherlock Holmes story!!,2018-05-31T19:57:07Z
KittyKatGaming,"I&#39;m torn between shieldmaiden Brigitte and forest spirit orisa, but I play Brigitte more, so If I can buy one, I&#39;ll get that",2018-06-09T08:10:06Z
KittyKatGaming,Great video as always~!!! &lt;3 Just fyi! The Mei dance is from the Anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya! From the ending Hare Hare Yukai~! Not k-pop~ ;3,2018-05-31T19:09:21Z
KittyKatGaming,The orisa skin was my fav til I realized everyone to ever play orisa again was gonna use it.,2018-05-31T19:34:46Z

KittyKatGaming,You know Pharah got a skin from the rooster event right?,2018-05-31T22:23:29Z
KittyKatGaming,I believe that the best skin for symmetra would be removing her entirely.,2018-05-31T19:55:39Z
KittyKatGaming,Moira&#39;s dance could have been Irish step dancing...,2018-05-31T21:46:32Z
KittyKatGaming,or a vikings vs pirate level. attacking side is pirate themed defense is vikings.,2018-05-31T21:03:51Z
KittyKatGaming,Doomfist had the best skin in my opinion,2018-06-01T02:15:39Z
KittyKatGaming,Mei’s dance is actually from an old anime,2018-06-01T04:33:25Z
KittyKatGaming,I may be cofused but you did get the scion outfit for hanzo in your last unboxing video,2018-07-02T06:54:48Z
KittyKatGaming,Brigitte&#39;s skin should&#39;ve been called Bear-gitte,2018-05-31T18:49:10Z
KittyKatGaming,I think symmetra&#39;s skin is a reference to zatanna.,2018-05-31T20:38:06Z
KittyKatGaming,&quot;Which sounds vaguely sexual.&quot;<br><br>Suzy 2018,2018-06-01T17:50:10Z

KittyKatGaming,I JUST GOT A OVERWATCH ANNIVERSARY AD WTF,2018-05-31T18:29:38Z
KittyKatGaming,its second year,2018-06-02T20:20:59Z
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;m really glad this game exists... I&#39;m studying nursing and I&#39;ve never had myself a panic attack so this  helps me to understand a little how those people feel when having crisis and how I can help them better. <del>i hope this makes sense because i&#39;m not a english native speaker</del>,2015-11-12T18:27:45Z
KittyKatGaming,As someone who suffers from severe social anxiety and panic disorder I can say that this is nothing like the real deal and I didn&#39;t get &quot;triggered&quot; at all. But I&#39;m very glad someone out there is trying to raise awareness for mental disorders :),2015-11-12T19:08:32Z
KittyKatGaming,I&#39;d just like to thank you for the trigger warning. Thanks for being considerate.,2015-11-12T23:12:17Z
KittyKatGaming,"Thanks for the warning; I decided to watch anyway cause of curiosity, but it&#39;s nice of you to put a warning there. I&#39;m really glad that games like this exist; it means a lot to have them try to explore mental conditions, and this one did make me feel kind of uneasy, I have to say. The flashing of negative worries is good detail, and that&#39;s something that I can definitely notice with anxiety.",2015-11-13T03:50:50Z
KittyKatGaming,"I feel like this kinda made panic attacks seem more annoying than debilitating, but the flooding of negative thoughts was somewhat accurate to mine, and the inability to move. <br><br>On a separate note, I though an interesting idea would be to have a game like this that involved interacting with another person, with things like giving you the ability to type a response to them, but whenever you type a letter it has like a 5 second lag.",2015-11-12T18:24:28Z
KittyKatGaming,"I didn&#39;t think this would bother me but my breathing started to match the breathing in the game and I started to tense up and had to stop watching it. I&#39;ve been having anxiety attacks constantly this week and this really works. Probably not on everyone, but I&#39;m definitely going to show this to my friends so they can kinda understand it better.",2015-11-13T07:31:41Z
KittyKatGaming,"This was an interesting game. Anxiety attacks range in symptoms--anything from lightly stuttered breathing to upchucking your lunch--so I&#39;m not sure it really managed to touch on all of the experiences people with anxiety have. (Being able to replicate the unfocused frustration and aching of shoulders/neck that I personally feel might be a little more difficult to replicate in game form.) Regardless, I think it provides a nice, safe glimpse into the terrible experience for people who have never felt an attack before. It&#39;s an ambitious goal to be able to capture an altered mental state in a piece of media so kudos to the creator for having the balls to try.",2015-11-13T18:40:14Z
KittyKatGaming,Suzy needs to watch the Mega Man X Sequelitis and listen to Arin&#39;s explanation of &quot;conveyance&quot;.,2015-11-12T18:33:42Z
KittyKatGaming,thank you for playing this suzy &lt;3,2015-11-12T19:23:03Z
KittyKatGaming,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IEe7Y55SFE&amp;t=13m34s"">13:34</a> &quot;Or if it&#39;s triggered by us not doing breathing enough&quot; <br>Yes Suzy exactly this. You keep stopping the breathing when everything is still blurry. The beginning clearly said &quot;It is important to breathe correctly to stay calm.&quot;",2015-11-13T06:41:50Z
KittyKatGaming,"For those of you who are complaining that this game is boring or that it blows because this isn&#39;t how you experience anxiety or panic attacks, you have to remember that every person experiences anxiety differently. If you remember from the very beginning of the game, the creator said that they wanted to share <b>their</b> experience with others. Just because it&#39;s not what <b>you</b> experience doesn&#39;t mean that this simulation or the way that the creator experiences anxiety isn&#39;t valid.<br><br>I thought it was a decent simulation, especially since it really can be that hard to focus on your breathing while walking or doing anything else that is supposed to be &quot;natural&quot; for a person to do. This game can also help raise awareness about anxiety and panic attacks by showing just how serious they are and how they can impact a person&#39;s day-to-day life.",2015-11-13T21:22:16Z
KittyKatGaming,thank you for including the warnings suzy,2015-11-12T19:04:49Z
KittyKatGaming,"I think part of the controls being bad is on purpose, it&#39;s hard to work towards your objective while concentrating on your breathing. That said, I agree that this doesn&#39;t really mirror a panic attack well, but I can&#39;t think of anything better to do so though. My personal experience now that I&#39;ve grown a lot as a person and left a lot of my self loathing behind is that I will get an intense FEAR with an intense desire to  go somewhere safer, but the worst part to me is that there is no source for the fear, everything is normal and safe and I&#39;m terrified.",2017-04-12T03:23:22Z
KittyKatGaming,You have to keep breathing as you walk. You can go quite a long while without having the attack if you breathe properly. You gotta make sure you get the blue oval bursting out when you breathe to show you&#39;re doing it right.,2015-11-12T19:56:30Z
KittyKatGaming,I like the concept and that it&#39;s about raising awareness but the experience isn&#39;t really that close to real life.  I&#39;d be interested in seeing the concept fleshed out some more.,2015-11-13T17:28:05Z
