It´s all about timing and the right tactic here as the windows are small and barely no options to try as most will not work. The villagers can also waste time a lot of times if they get stuck, choose wrong paths etc. There are much that has to be done fast. The key is to secure the middle and where the tricky ends. The fire and water trees is pretty worthless on this one.. ﻿",2015-02-13T02:20:32Z

Just put down more earth than the waves can push back against. That&#39;s what I did with this map. Also, the totems/villages were the highest points on my run on this map.

Markiplier,i think i have a harder version or so<br>that misson was absolutely impossble for me,2014-01-28T12:59:32Z

Markiplier,"There should be an indicator above people&#39;s head that changes from green to red determining if they killed a player. Or not because that would remove some of the immersion. Also Mark, would it be too much to ask if you could make these episodes 30 mins long, I really enjoy them.",2013-12-13T03:34:16Z

Markiplier,You should really play this game with somebody like Bob or wade. I think you&#39;d have more fun that way and your chances would increase.,2014-02-23T04:12:25Z
Markiplier,Markiplier&#39;s a cop on the edge who lets his gun do the talking! And his gun only knows one really loud word!<br>(Shamelessly stolen from Zero Punctuation.),2013-12-12T23:20:01Z
Markiplier,"You should try playing with someone else! It&#39;s way easier that way. Also, if you open your global inventory (in a safe zone), you can access items from your last character (I&#39;m pretty sure anyways). Never played this but I know a few people who have, and they always talk about how hard it is, so it isn&#39;t just you.",2013-12-13T00:53:23Z

Markiplier,"MARK, (Please upvote so he sees this)<br>you can store 10 or 15 items at the safe zones, not sure of the exact amount, and if you die you can run to any safe zone storage and grab some or all the items out. You can store pretty much anything there, guns, melee weapons, food, medi kits, ammo etc.",2013-12-12T23:09:05Z

Markiplier,Heart attacks are the best way to start off an episode.,2015-07-25T04:13:02Z
Markiplier,"Nether Mark, not zombies! More tips for players:<br>1. You lose some cash if you are killed or commit suicide<br>2. Never enter a safezone without an escape plan. Watch your back<br>3. Museum Outpost and the center Safezone are safest and easiest to reach<br>4. Players cannot kill or shoot guns in the safezones <br>5. Don&#39;t buy anything but ammunition for guns, everything else is easy to scavenge<br>6. Avoid water/puddles, it&#39;s loud and alerts players/nether easily. <br>7. If you get &quot;stuck&quot; on a ledge or something, switch to crouch or crawl and it will unstick you. It&#39;s a small bug i hope they fix soon.<br>8. The map as you thought is restricted until out of beta. So 64 payers per server with a much larger map will be better with less campers and run ins with bandits. ",2013-12-12T22:08:15Z
Markiplier,"Seriously, if I ever played this game and met you there, I wouldn&#39;t kill you XD  You have my word!",2013-12-17T03:08:03Z
Markiplier,Mark I think in the safe zone other player&#39;s can&#39;t shoot you which is why that guy earlier didn&#39;t immediately shoot you.,2013-12-14T18:20:08Z

Markiplier,Mark i seen you seem to have a bit of trouble on the game a wee bit so here something that may help<br><br>1) Us M-key to open mini-map<br>2) Always get the Block ability<br>3) never sprint places unless you in the open but make sure there are not nether near you (that&#39;s what the monsters are called Nether&#39;s)<br>4) Don&#39;t stay in one area too long increases the chance of running in to nether and players,2013-12-13T06:12:30Z

Markiplier,"Just a couple things I read up on: The Battle Axe swings as fast as a knife for plenty more damage. The Bolo Sword was a great find. I&#39;m sorry you lost it. And the GRIMM Reaper seems to be a popular melee weapon since it has more reach than the knife and does more damage. But if you find a Katana. TAKE IT. It&#39;s the best melee weapon in the game right now. Hope this helps any, Mark!",2013-12-13T02:33:42Z

Markiplier,"Regardless of whether it was lag, or just Mark&#39;s reflexes not being fast enough, or just the animation being too long that his character died before it concluded, the way this concluded would make for an awesome, if not depressing end to a movie. A group of soldiers stuck on an island full of zombies, one taken out immediately after landing, one that died as they were looting the care package, and the last two falling at the top of one of the hills, and just before he could go out in a blaze of glory, the last soldier is killed and drops the Molotov harmlessly, the rain putting out the fire and not letting it spread to the grass around, ensuring the zombies retain dominion over the island.",2017-08-23T07:22:45Z

But he&#39;s really awesome at this kind of stuff and he creates my type of horror.

But with you, it feels like you truly feel like you&#39;re playing some games with your friends (friends being your subs), and I would like to thank you for that. I know we will never meet, I know we are on different continents, and I know you really are just a guy from Ireland with a camera, but for 20 minutes a day I feel like I&#39;m actually talking with a friend.

It truly changes the entire game! It&#39;s so much better now! Please make at least one more episode that tries out the new campaign!",2017-08-14T01:45:45Z
jacksepticeye,I want to see him play it again because of how much it&#39;s improved over time,2023-01-03T18:52:00Z
jacksepticeye,Just got the game and i LOVE it!,2018-12-25T19:20:38Z
jacksepticeye,I think the arrival counter is how long it will take you to reach there if you keep walking.,2016-08-10T04:46:10Z
jacksepticeye,It&#39;s always cool to go back and look at old gameplay of this game to see how much it has changed,2020-02-24T18:15:16Z
jacksepticeye,"Jack I&#39;ve had the most rotten day ever and I was feeling like absolute shit, but watching even ten minute of your video made me so happy man. You have a personality that just lights up a room and you are one of the most humble, genuine, and personable you tubers out there. You&#39;re amazing, and I will never get tired of watching your videos. Thank you so much for making my day better. <b>HIGH FIVE</b>",2016-08-18T06:22:32Z
jacksepticeye,Admittedly even back then the game still looked and sounded amazing 💯,2023-04-23T16:37:29Z
jacksepticeye,It&#39;s interesting to see how much the game has changed over the years I just got the game the other day but watched your let&#39;s play when it came out figured I&#39;d come back and re watch this masterpiece,2022-04-18T16:36:31Z
jacksepticeye,Man this game has changed a lot since launch.,2022-04-25T06:42:00Z
jacksepticeye,I legitimately want the center of the universe to be earth.,2016-08-10T14:45:59Z
jacksepticeye,"I love this game. So much. I&#39;ve really been enjoying watching all my favorite YouTubers play it. The graphics, and the gathering/building aspect, reminds me of Subnautica, which I also love. :D Fantastic game!",2016-08-26T18:33:43Z

jacksepticeye,good to see this great video series are getting  watched in 2020,2020-08-02T23:05:39Z
jacksepticeye,the game devs for this should add an easter egg of a water planet with a huge ship crashed on it,2016-08-10T19:59:09Z
jacksepticeye,"The best part of the game is the start, especially if the planet you&#39;re on is a hostile environment (too hot or too cold), as this really feels like a cool survival and priority event. After that, it&#39;s like watching paint dry.",2016-08-22T02:21:26Z
jacksepticeye,"Now we see proof that Jack would not survive Jurassic Park... <br>Others: OH GOD RUN<br>Jack: It&#39;s so cute, just dropping a squat! Wanna be my friend? <b>squash</b>",2017-08-12T23:40:52Z

jacksepticeye,I can&#39;t wait until you can play as more dinosaurs! This game is amazing.,2017-08-14T16:12:52Z
jacksepticeye,"Jack, they keep killing you because you&#39;re just biting at their legs. As a raptor, you&#39;re supposed to jump on the back of your prey.",2017-08-12T00:50:06Z
jacksepticeye,&quot;Can I look at my face? Awwww! That&#39;s the face of a dinosaur that&#39;s seen some shit.&quot; Only Jack would say that 😂😂,2017-08-13T10:29:04Z
jacksepticeye,"This game is spectacular for me, because since the age of about 7, I have wanted to be a paleontologist. Its what I plan to go to college for. I love dinosaurs, so to see a game about dinosaurs is super cool for me. Especially when you get to be the dinosaur.",2017-08-13T04:53:08Z

jacksepticeye,Jack yelling &quot;I died!&quot; in a baby voice is why I live.,2017-08-11T20:42:45Z
jacksepticeye,"To jacksepticeye: The game Saurian is supposed to give you an up-to-date simulation of what life was like in Hell Creek, a geological formation in what is now Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming. It is famous for it&#39;s amazingly preserved fossil record that gave us an almost perfect picture of what life was like in North America 66-65 million years ago, before the KPG mass extinction. Every detail, right down to the plants in the game and how the animals behave, is based on what paleontologists know from the fossil record and how regular animals behave today. <br><br>The animal you played as was not a Utahraptor, it was a Dakotaraptor. Utahraptor lived 125 million years ago, 60 million years earlier than Dakotaraptor, and was much bigger. Utahraptor was about 23ft long and less than 500 kilograms, about as big as a polar bear, while Dakotaraptor was 18ft long and about as big as the fake raptors of Jurassic Park. And while Dakotaraptor was built in the same was as most dromaeosaurs, Utahraptor was more robust and built less for speed and more for taking down large tough prey.",2017-08-16T01:48:58Z
jacksepticeye,You should play more of this,2017-08-15T13:32:50Z
jacksepticeye,Sean The Whole Time: &quot;MEAT ON DEM BOOOOONES&quot;,2019-11-24T03:53:43Z
jacksepticeye,I love the dinosaur run cycle. When Jack screamed &quot;HE KNOWS&quot; and then sprinted away I lost it.😂,2017-08-19T13:54:35Z
jacksepticeye,Hell yeah Jack! Make more episodes! there are a LOT of new updates!,2019-06-10T18:39:30Z
jacksepticeye,Dinosaur + jack = FASCINATING AND AMAZING AS FUCK!!,2017-08-12T05:18:55Z
jacksepticeye,It&#39;s great how Jack still remembers the &#39;Utahraptors&#39; from &#39;The Hunter Primal&#39;. Too bad he forgot to kill a T-Rex.,2017-08-13T11:24:29Z
jacksepticeye,"&quot;Does anyone got some meat on dem bones?&quot; he sounds so funny,this is why I watch his channel",2018-06-20T17:46:31Z

jacksepticeye,Jack you eventually grow up and be able to hunt larger prey I recommend playing till adulthood because it changes the game completely,2017-08-12T01:04:52Z
jacksepticeye,This game is so cute! Besides the death but the creatures are adorable! I want a pet dinosaur!,2017-08-15T02:12:25Z

jacksepticeye,This is adorable to watch and a nice change of pace from huge plot related games I like it a lot! Keep on being you Sean!,2017-08-13T02:20:41Z
jacksepticeye,"Saurian has updated so much since then it&#39;s just getting better and better! You should try it out again. Of course there are still quite a few bugs and issues that need to be fixed and many animals that need to be added. Actually just the other day I was watching a Saurian stream for animating their Ornithomimus model and it&#39;s coming along great! Games like these are important because most dinosaurs in media are not portrayed accurately or justly at all. Not only is it visually stunning and incredibly immersive, it&#39;s also very educational and eye-opening.",2018-02-18T06:19:25Z
jacksepticeye,I was feeling super sleep deprived then 2 minutes in I felt like I had slept for 12 hours straight! Jack is a fucking boss god!,2017-08-12T11:43:45Z

DanTDM,Emeralds are at mid. Put your stuff you don&#39;t need for now in the chest. Kill a bed to get access to their normal chest. It&#39;s best to build a thick layer of obi and ends tone for the dragons if you get that far. The dragons can now destroy any block so build multiple layers. Stock up on emeralds for obi. Buy a bow to kill the dragons.,2017-07-01T01:59:21Z

DanTDM,"Fun Fact, if you run this mod with the Touhou Items Mod also installed, you unlock extra dolls that wield Danmaku in combat.

DanTDM,"Touhou (Pronounced Toe Hoe) is a series of Arcade Shooters made by ZUN. It truly is a great series of games, the storyline for each game is really cool, and the music is amazing.The character, Alice Margatroid, uses these dolls in combat as she fights against you. 

Just thought I&#39;d share this with you, I am a hardcore Touhou fan. :)",2013-09-15T00:24:47Z

Ninja,"Considering he won a game and came second twice (so almost winning twice) and got a couple of top 8&#39;s and whatnot, I&#39;d say he did amazing. Don&#39;t forget he was wearing a suit more than half the time and had a lot more pressure since there was more people watching and was the center of the attention of actual people on a stage; also the pressure for him too win since it&#39;s his own event. He also died one game from being killed by the winner and one death was him dying after killing someone so he didn&#39;t expect it. He actually did amazing. Especially comparing to how Myth did? Yikes. I still think Ninja is the best honestly.",2018-04-26T08:46:25Z

Ninja,"Everyone should watch Ninja on H3. Most of the players were good, some were bad. He had a bounty, so 99 people were after him. When people recognized his building skills and what not they would gang him for $2500. Ninja is still one of the best. The fact that he placed 2nd twice and got first against 99 other people, battle royal style proves it. No top players get first every time folks.",2018-04-24T08:01:53Z

theRadBrad,"Awesome, keep them up I&#39;m enjoying them. One thing I&#39;ll also say is that you need to put auto aim on, relying on deadeye alone is not as fun, deadeye can be used when you&#39;re taking out multiple targets in style. Idk if anyone has mentioned it yet but press R1 on multiple enemies during deadeye and the full advantage of it will be taken",2018-10-31T12:32:21Z

theRadBrad,"MORE!!! POST MORE!!! DROP ALL THE LIKES! I&#39;ve been watching you for years man, i never really commented much or anything. I just put it on full screen and enjoy it. I watch you and Sips, and a few more i watch on and off. But generally both of yous are the guys to watch for gaming. One observation i want to ask you about, ok so you use inverted controls. Up is down, down is up. What was your first game that you ever played? Was it by any chance a fighter jet game of any kind? Like flying? Because you use the basic logic behind controlling an aircraft&#39;s joy stick. You pull the stick towards you to bring the aircraft up. My thoughts are that maybe one of your first ever games was a flying one. But if that is not true and you have not played many games based on flying at all... Maybe you should try one out, as for my observation i would guess that you would be naturally good at them.",2018-10-31T17:56:46Z
theRadBrad,I would like to see more videos from you if that&#39;s possible. I dont personally dont think its spamming at all. I pretty much been watching your videos for a couple years now. I always enjoyed them especially if it&#39;s a game I really like.,2018-10-31T12:16:17Z

IMHO, he has to play through so many games to make money instead of playing fewer games but higher quality play through.<br><br>I like Brad and I think most people offering suggestions do too.  If Brad just listening to what was going on in the game (camp, NPCs say to Arthur, etc.) I bet his view counts would rise because the quality of the play through would be so much higher.",2018-10-31T19:04:00Z

theRadBrad,One of the best traits of Arthur is that he isn&#39;t racist he actually rants at the kkk leader in meeting where one person gets lit ablaze and everyone flees he rants at the leader if you punch him and knock him out its so cool how he isn&#39;t racist and is accepting of all races and it shows when you return Jeremiah&#39;s things and you find out he was a slave trader and he just burns his ledgar while saying his(Jeremiah) legacy should be one of the few that should be burned and forgotten considering he sold slaves to others and Arthur hated that,2020-07-26T21:12:13Z

theRadBrad,You have done a wonderful Job at playing the game and commenting. Your play style is so darn funny and it makes me laugh. You are few years older than my grandsons age and I used to watch them play as I taught them when they were real young. Hearing that you joyfully visit your grandmother and your mother makes me so happy to hear about. You are so right we are here for such a short time and we all should appreciate our time together. Please keep up your video postings of your game play. I do so enjoy them. I lost interest in gaming after my wife passed from breast cancer. We had a short 43 years together. I stumbled on to your videos of this game and it brought me to a place of interest in gaming again since her death. I feel interested in playing again. I usually do not comment ; but I am following your videos. Again Thank you for the fine job! Finnish the game!,2019-11-24T15:55:20Z

theRadBrad,"Just for anyone watching this who is starting to play the game:<br>- Farm a Hornet corrosive legendary pistol from Knuckledragger early on (go to see Hammerlock, then after you&#39;ve leveled up, go BACK to KD to get the Hornet - it can take you up to level 12-15 even if it is level 1)<br>- Farm for a Unkempt Harold legendary explosive pistol from Savage Lee after you get to Sanctuary (seriously, it can take you up to level 15-20)<br>- Farm for a hellfire legendary fire SMG from scorch (again, its incredible splash damage and fire damage belies its specs)<br>- Make sure to pick up the blue rarity Lascaux SMG from the shallow pool in the caves, same place as Scorch (look it up)<br>- Farm for the Nukem rocket launcher from the boss in the area behind Ellie&#39;s garage in The Dust <br>- If you have the money, you can try for one of the Moxxi good touch or bad touch guns, they give you constant health regen and the corrosive one is great against robots.<br><br>This will make the game MUCH easier regardless of which player you pick. I wish someone told me this when I was starting. Just a suggestion!!",2019-01-31T03:17:31Z

Youtuber,Comments,Date
GameGrumps,arin doing literally anything but the assigned chores is peak adhd behaviour,2022-11-16T19:15:26Z
GameGrumps,You can’t run from Sonic forever Arin. He always catches up to you. He is the fastest thing alive.,2022-11-16T18:12:04Z
GameGrumps,This game is a very accurate portrayal of trying to do everyday tasks while suffering from major depressive disorder.,2022-11-18T04:52:56Z
GameGrumps,Arin somehow missing the point that the dude is struggling just to get through the day from depression with all the little hints.,2022-11-16T21:40:06Z
GameGrumps,Anyone else keep yelling at Arin to feed Nugget or was that just me?,2022-11-16T20:05:26Z
GameGrumps,The way this main character encountered one obstacle to starting his day and immediately contemplated giving up is extremely relatable.,2022-11-16T19:28:36Z
GameGrumps,&quot;How did you do this when you were a kid? I just jumped and shooted.&quot;<br><br>Arin perfectly encapsulating the duality of the Grumps.,2022-11-16T18:12:36Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Does your girlfriend, like, get you?&quot; is the rawest shit Arin has said in a while.",2022-11-16T20:42:53Z
GameGrumps,Maybe they should just let Dan always play the point and click games.,2022-11-16T20:01:38Z
GameGrumps,"I like how Arin was in the kitchen, looked at all the items, clearly hovered over the cat food, and yet failed to find it and feed the cat.",2022-11-16T19:21:28Z
GameGrumps,"game objective; find pants, feed cat, get ready for work<br>Arin the game boy; cleans kitchen and makes the bed, very nice.",2022-11-16T18:27:54Z
GameGrumps,"How does Arin, Owner of cats, not know cats lick their own butts...",2022-11-16T19:12:43Z
GameGrumps,Dude Arin and Dan really sound like the parents who look at a depressed teenager and go “WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO BE DEPRESSED ABOUT?”,2022-11-22T16:41:21Z
GameGrumps,its funny that the grumps don&#39;t think this guy&#39;s day is that bad when i know for a fact i would go fetal half way through.,2022-11-16T23:52:03Z
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m so upset that after all the effort of finding dirty dishes, Arin never picked up the ones in the basement and finished the task.",2022-11-16T23:45:24Z
GameGrumps,"I&#39;m not sure as it&#39;s only a hour-ish long game and I don&#39;t know the creator&#39;s intent, but this really seems like a story about a person suffering from executive dysfunction. It&#39;s a symptom that often accompanies depression and can make doing &quot;mundane&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; tasks very difficult mentally and emotionally. I appreciate that Carla was supportive and kind at the end there in spite of the difficult time she apparently had.",2022-11-17T03:01:55Z
GameGrumps,"When they gave the character crap for when he went fetal - that part of the game actually hit for me. That&#39;s someone who had an awful day the day before - got in a fight with Carla, the cereal incident - and now everything&#39;s going wrong this morning. When you lose that last spoon, and you don&#39;t have the emotional capacity to deal with anything else, it&#39;s not going from 0 to 100 - it&#39;s going from 95 to 105, and was just getting covered up before.<br><br>Do what you gotta do, Dave. Take your time, take care of yourself. When you&#39;re ready to get up again, you&#39;ve got this. Until then, I understand and have your back.",2022-11-19T01:35:24Z
GameGrumps,"I see this more as a depiction of depression. Some days, its hard to get out of bed.... and then these &quot;little things&quot; Dan and Arin keep joking about, really take a toll on you. To be honest, after he dropped his coffee, I would&#39;ve given up on the day if I was having a depressive episode. The ending was kinda showing how it feels to accomplish even the smallest task.",2022-11-16T23:31:22Z
GameGrumps,"Man, even if things are going okay, you can still feel depressed. I feel you, Dave.",2022-11-16T19:05:09Z
GameGrumps,"This game definitely is reminiscent of Executive Dysfunction, ADHD, Depression, and a few other things you could throw in to make basic chores harder. It was really sweet that Carla was understanding and nice even if it was just minor inconveniences, since trying to force yourself to do chores when suffering a chronic illness, can feel like trying to put your hand on a hot stove at times.",2022-11-16T21:31:50Z
GameGrumps,"I like how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkV3C5wY6oo&amp;t=51m18s"">51:18</a> Dan&#39;s like &quot;It just gets really heavy&quot; like they didn&#39;t just watch someone almost have a complete emotional breakdown not five minutes prior.",2022-11-23T21:00:28Z
GameGrumps,This game is like... Exactly how executive dysfunction feels,2022-11-16T20:28:56Z
GameGrumps,&quot;gosh i wish i could eat cereal&quot; - Arin<br>the latest 10 minute power hour-,2022-11-16T19:21:08Z
GameGrumps,Dan saying &quot;this humor is like &#39;boss at meeting&#39; humor&quot; infront of his actual boss takes serious balls.,2022-11-16T22:24:45Z
GameGrumps,"This perfectly encapsulates having anxiety when I wake up for work. I&#39;m the guy making excuses to not go, and Arin and Dan are my subconscious yelling at me to JUST GO!!!",2022-11-17T15:20:11Z
GameGrumps,only Arin could play a chore simulator WITH A WALKTHROUGH  and STILL get confused lmfaooo,2022-11-16T19:52:43Z
GameGrumps,"i don&#39;t know how Dan doesn&#39;t give in and say &quot;Arin, please feed the cat&quot;",2022-11-17T00:41:02Z
GameGrumps,i like how Arin picked the perfect voice for the mother before even reading her messages,2022-11-16T18:36:10Z
GameGrumps,I love that a game about finding pants to put on is more Dan’s speed. 😂,2022-11-16T18:19:41Z
GameGrumps,Arin: &quot;cereal is so bad for you!&quot; Also Arin: &quot;ALL ANIMAL FOOD IS DELICIOUS AND GOOD FOR YOU!&quot;,2022-11-16T20:19:32Z
GameGrumps,Arin: “I cant eat cereal it’s so bad for you” <br>Danny: has Vietnam flashbacks to literally everything Arins ingested on 10 min power hour,2022-11-18T19:17:53Z
GameGrumps,Subtlety is not Arin’s strong suit.,2022-11-17T00:44:06Z
GameGrumps,Honestly the cats walk cycle is so delightful that I literally replayed bits where the cat walks a little because it’s just so enjoyable to see it’s cute little trot,2022-12-02T02:24:42Z
GameGrumps,"As someone with chronic fatigue and other health issues, this game perfectly emulates what basic tasks feel like to me",2022-11-16T18:51:23Z
GameGrumps,"Arin, fixing a broken hot water heater, a power outage, fumbling with an insane washer, and putting out a fire: These are just normal everyday things!",2022-11-17T01:01:16Z
GameGrumps,Can’t get over how refined Dan’s female voice acting is. It’s so on point.,2022-11-16T18:28:45Z
GameGrumps,as someone who talks to himself like I&#39;m my own best friend I feel attacked,2022-11-16T20:48:54Z
GameGrumps,"This game feels like how my brain is with every task I have to do, to the point I forget what I had started to do in the first place.",2022-11-16T20:22:35Z
GameGrumps,Arin neglecting to feed the cat as it started to meow more and more needily made me almost cry,2022-11-17T01:38:23Z
GameGrumps,Arin: &quot;Cereal is so bad for you&quot;<br>also Arin: orally vacuums 18 variations of Cheerios on 10MPH,2022-11-17T01:59:23Z
GameGrumps,"the ending of this game reminds me of the procrastination episode of spongebob, where spongebob spends all night struggling to find the motivation to write his essay, finally does it and then finds out he didnt actually have to write anything. also both of these things depict what its like to have executive dysfunction pretty well",2022-11-21T14:10:53Z
GameGrumps,If this episode isn&#39;t the perfect expression of ADHD,2022-11-16T18:46:10Z
GameGrumps,I like how Arin was subconsciously thinking of his own cats when he was first reading the to-do list. He said &quot;cats&quot; when there was only one cat and it read as such,2022-11-17T00:36:15Z
GameGrumps,Finally. A point and click game whose theme and tone feel appropriate for the gameplay.,2022-11-16T19:26:39Z
GameGrumps,"I REALLY need Danny to play Darkside Detective. Made by a Sierra fan, I had so much fun with the humor it had and I know Dan would too",2022-11-17T03:17:48Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;I&#39;m just... Reading a book and it&#39;s really compelling!&quot;  Great cover Arin, no one suspects a thing",2022-11-16T19:26:20Z
GameGrumps,“God I wish I could eat cereal”- Arin 24 hours after posting himself eating every Cheerios,2022-11-16T22:12:25Z
GameGrumps,I NEEDED THIS VIDEO THREE HOURS AGO...now I have no pants and everyone at this Denny&#39;s is staring at me.,2022-11-16T18:23:12Z
GameGrumps,"Ooh, an hour long episode. Great, I had a thing to put off",2022-11-16T18:04:28Z
GameGrumps,I actually need to do the dishes and laundry but instead I am watching someone else play a game that has them doing chores.,2022-11-16T19:23:25Z
GameGrumps,"Haha thanks a lot guys. That was hilarious. Don’t hesitate to play again, The Messenger has a LOT of surprises in store for you to make fun with. 💕",2018-10-08T21:47:54Z
GameGrumps,"&quot;Wow, they&#39;re playing The Messenger! I&#39;m so excited!&quot;<br>*Arin leaves without talking to the Shopkeeper&quot;<br>&quot;THIS PLAYTHROUGH IS DEAD!&quot;",2018-10-09T06:23:40Z
GameGrumps,I hope they quote Arin for game reviews <br><br>&quot;This game rips shit&quot; -Arin Hanson,2018-10-08T20:29:21Z
GameGrumps,-Hey Billy what was your favorite Game Grumps episode?<br>-I really like the one where Arin talked about his shits for a looooong time,2018-10-08T18:31:07Z
GameGrumps,"I wish I had a cool friend to play this game with and comment on it and crack jokes like these two guys. I had to play it by myself and have inner dialogues with myself about how cool this game is, like a crazy person. Cruel fate.",2018-10-08T20:44:32Z
GameGrumps,"Man, I wish they played it long enough to show off the most unique feature of the game. You swap between 8-bit and 16-bit versions of the game.",2018-10-08T18:37:46Z
GameGrumps,"This game really deserves and needs the exposure.  Last I heard, even though The Messenger received many positive reviews, its sales were particularly low for an indie game on Switch, which is a real shame.  This game is super fun, creative, challenging and witty, and anyone with a love of call-back platformers like this should play it.  And if you are interested, I&#39;d recommend simply buying it and not watching any trailers or gameplay videos beyond the early game, as they may spoil the game&#39;s most important mechanic.  Hell, the game even makes a joke itself about that mechanic being spoiled in the trailer.",2018-10-08T23:26:51Z
GameGrumps,If you will make this a series and not just a single episode PLEASE talk chat more with the shop keeper cuz half of this game&#39;s humor is mainly in the conversations with him,2018-10-08T19:32:00Z
GameGrumps,"Huh.   A ninja game.  If only they knew a practicing parishioner of ninjitsu to have given their highly qualified, some might even say, doctoral, review of this game.",2018-10-08T23:20:46Z
GameGrumps,"Why is it that literally no one I know could relate to my bathroom habits but then Arin comes in and just absolutely justified my habits as natural, what is this weird sense of relation with him I feel right now?",2018-10-09T05:48:42Z
GameGrumps,Do you guys ever think you&#39;ll ever finish the game? It&#39;s incredible,2020-09-02T15:50:20Z
GameGrumps,I have never related more to Arin than the poop talk in this video,2018-10-08T19:19:42Z
GameGrumps,I need to buy this game eventually,2018-10-08T18:14:40Z
GameGrumps,Oh... I really want this to be a series. Let&#39;s Game It Out did great run of this featuring Ninja Bobby and I wish I could see them finish it too.,2020-07-21T07:59:12Z

GameGrumps,Aww I&#39;d love to see more episodes of this!,2018-10-09T16:51:17Z
GameGrumps,I would have loved it if all 4 of that giant-ass demon’s heads all had their own individual personalities and dialogue.  And the four of them are constantly arguing or something.,2018-10-08T18:26:57Z
GameGrumps,please keep this one going!! indie sidescrollers always have the best stories,2018-10-11T18:02:57Z

GameGrumps,Thank you Matt and Ryan for our perfect hour late upload. You truly are the kings of consistently being inconsistent. Right next to doctor Jekyll and two face!,2018-10-08T18:22:15Z

GameGrumps,Arin&#39;s fake story about the creator of Biker Mice reminded me of what happened to the director of one of the shittiest movies I&#39;ve ever seen. A man named Tom Graeff created &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot;. The movie bombed and he had a breakdown and claimed he was the second coming of Christ. Then he killed himself by locking himself in his garage with his car running.,2014-01-16T23:44:54Z

GameGrumps,"This is a fantastic single player AND multiplayer game. Fairly easy to pick up (if you know the controls anyway), but difficult to master.  The controls are great, very responsive, and the combination of unique powerups and ammo ensures there&#39;s no shortage of action when you meet your rivals on the track. Really fun.",2018-09-25T11:43:23Z
GameGrumps,I used to love this game as a kid. It&#39;d be great to see a 2nd video of you guys playing this :),2014-01-18T17:46:43Z

GameGrumps,Ahhh the smell of Woolie&#39;s saltyness is still fresh in the air.  ,2014-01-16T22:08:48Z
GameGrumps,"I think i speak for all my other fellow grumps here when i say it&#39;s great and nostalgic when Arin and Dan play a classic SNES game. And im not talking about the really popular ones, but rather the ones that get overlook like &quot;Cool Spot&quot; and &quot;Biker Mice From Mars&quot; the lsit is endless. I hope dan and Arin take more time digging deep into the SNES vault and continue to give us amazing episodes where we can all take a trip to our beloved childhood.",2014-01-18T05:11:24Z
GameGrumps,"Biker mice from mars were brilliant, I&#39;ve still got a video of them somewhere. You don&#39;t hear them mentioned often these days but they were by far the coolest heroes of the old cartoons",2014-01-16T23:16:36Z

GameGrumps,"I remember playing this game with my bro, so much rage and fun!",2014-01-17T00:15:00Z
GameGrumps,This game was my childhood. You don&#39;t understand how joyful and painful this was to watch. P.S.- Karbunkle&#39;s shot is what was turning Danny into the &quot;potato&quot; man. You can bump racers with that crazy spin Vinny has. The obvious Mario Kart style specials at the top of the screen are used by pressing B if um remembering correctly. And Moto is the best!!,2016-12-13T11:26:45Z
GameGrumps,Dan hopped up on sugar is the beginning of a spiral of cause-effect hyping up between these two and it&#39;s hilarious.,2016-12-02T19:32:15Z

GameGrumps,"Grew up with this game was my 5th birthday present. Very very hard game to master, but its a lot of fun. Vinny and the grey mouse (used to say gotcha) where my faves. Vinny must spam the jump boost and cornering boost, one of the hardest to race with but far from worthless",2014-01-17T07:16:20Z
GameGrumps,"I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of Woolies suddenly cried out in salt.",2014-01-16T23:45:44Z

GameGrumps,"Biker Mice from Mars creator, Richard Ungar, is not dead. He still activly writes cartoon epsodes for a company called 41 Entertainment. He is 66 years old.",2016-03-09T07:52:52Z
GameGrumps,"Vinny is the best. I won every circuit on hard with Vinny. With his power he&#39;s actually the fastest character, it&#39;s like an extended boost and the most OP shortcut maker.",2014-01-16T23:12:03Z
GameGrumps,"GUYS. IMPORTANT!!!<br><br>There&#39;s a point in the video around <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9SczD-S83Y&amp;t=3m27s"">3:27</a> where Dan starts saying &quot;I will never fuck--&quot;, stops, and then corrects himself with &quot;I will never doubt you&quot;<br><br>;)",2014-01-17T01:53:06Z
GameGrumps,"How can Danny hate this episode? It spawned one of my favorite GG memes of all time, the Akira joke.  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br><br>Also does anyone else miss this style of editing?  I deeply miss having the mysterious silent editor only existing through the on screen edits (although obviously I&#39;m happy to have Barry on the show now too).",2016-12-02T09:24:02Z
GameGrumps,"I totally fucking remember these things. I used to have so many of those toys when I was younger. Vinnie was my favourite of them... Not because I liked him, but rather because his antennae(which could slide in and out of his head) were bent, thus never allowing the sliding gimmick to work properly. This always amused me as a child, for some reason.",2015-06-11T22:50:45Z
GameGrumps,"I loved Biker Mice From Mars as a kid back in the 90&#39;s, I know they tried to reboot the franchise ten years ago, but it failed horribly.",2014-05-28T16:18:43Z

GameGrumps,Why are everybody writing &quot;WHAT IS THIS GAME?!&quot;? It&#39;s a damn classic! I&#39;m really surprised to see that people are so unfamiliar with it (including the grumps). ,2014-11-05T21:12:57Z
GameGrumps,Black and white... One of the best games ever... I had to upgrade my pc back then when it came out... From win98 to win xp... Good ol times :),2014-11-05T22:30:15Z

GameGrumps,"Those dancing skeletons make me wish there was a dancing skeleton game. They could call it dancing skeletons, people could dress up like skeletons, and all the songs could be skeleton related.",2014-11-06T00:16:46Z
GameGrumps,"Guys, you need to gather resources yourself by picking them up and dropping them onto your storage building. The turtle can build and do stuff automatically. Make to villagers build buildings, reproduce and gather resources, while you gather resources etc. Then you can add villages and expand your territory. Else you gonna be smitten by satan...<br><br>But it is a pretty weird game so I get the confusion. Also please don&#39;t let satan kill this playthrough, I love it.",2014-11-05T22:27:35Z

GameGrumps,I wanna see Barry playing the game sometime. =D,2014-11-16T01:58:04Z
GameGrumps,I played this game a decade ago it feels like. And seeing Ross think the turtle makes them define their class just made me cringe. ,2014-11-05T20:59:04Z

GameGrumps,Black and White is actually really fun. I wonder if they realize they&#39;re not playing the beginning of 2… It looks like an expansion. Cause the original starts off fighting the Aztecs and freeing the Greeks.,2014-11-06T06:32:40Z
GameGrumps,"Loved both Black&amp;White games, havent played in ages but watching them play this is dreadful. But entertaining. In a masochistic way.",2014-11-05T22:10:52Z
GameGrumps,The only thing I know about Ventrilo is it&#39;s good for annoying people with soundboards of Duke Nukem.,2014-11-05T20:16:10Z
GameGrumps,I laughed so hard at the ventrillo joke XD I remember when that was the thing to use :p,2014-11-06T00:43:26Z

GameGrumps,I thought this game was hella easy to play. How can Ross make it seem so difficult? He&#39;s not picking up on context clues maybe cause he&#39;s hungover ...,2014-11-05T22:58:32Z
GameGrumps,I thought the point of playthroughs are to see how the lets player interacts and thinks of the game an it doesnt have to mean they are good at it or have to be good at it ,2014-11-05T21:18:45Z

GameGrumps,"The motion controls in Skyward Sword worked perfectly fine for me. It made it a little more entertaining than just mashing B a bunch of times to attack. My only gripe is the bullshit where you have to collect the little light orbs, those levels were frustrating.",2014-08-10T21:20:17Z
GameGrumps,"I laughed forever when Dan sneezed, it was so god damn adorable ",2014-08-10T22:39:51Z

GameGrumps,"The motion controls in Skyward Sword worked fine for me. The only times they&#39;d mess up is over extended periods of play (like over an hour, which is understandable) or whenever I enter the water. I hated the water in that game....

Otherwise, I had no problems with the mechanics used with the wii motion plus. I barely had to re-calibrate the wiimote, and the combat was seamless.

GameGrumps,There are a lot of games that have you hurt badguys by bumping into them. The first one that comes to mind for me is Ys Book I&amp;II for the TurboGrafx/TurboDuo. I would LOVE to see them play some TurboDuo games. They need an addition to GG that plays the &quot;retro&quot; games (proper &quot;retro&quot; not what many gamers consider to be retro these days). They clearly do it now and then but it would be so good to have one who focuses on those games.,2014-08-10T21:39:28Z

GameGrumps,"I know Arin was saying it sarcastically, but that game where you hurt enemies by touching them is actually a good idea. Like enemies would have melee or distance weapons and they would always avoid you, which could lead you around platforming obstacles. or every level could be like the nabbit levels from mario bros U where you have one enemy to kill but you have to traverse some kind of obstacle course to catch them and you&#39;re rewarded for doing it quicker.",2015-07-24T02:09:49Z

CoryxKenshin,Keep it up plz,2019-10-24T20:35:36Z
CoryxKenshin,"I feel like this whole game was a message about the youth and their toxic love affair with drugs.. Dude shows up at a party, takes some drugs then has no idea what&#39;s going on, where he is, who he&#39;s talking to and who he&#39;s about to sleep with. Vinny sounds like this voice coming from somewhere out of reality because dude is super effed up on drugs. The player experiences his hallucinations and confusion, then at the end when dude is coming off the drugs everything becomes a LITTLE more clear. ",2014-07-28T17:36:03Z
CoryxKenshin,Cory&#39;s face after the credits were finished was my exact reaction,2016-02-15T03:08:23Z
CoryxKenshin,This is the most awkward &amp; screwed up plot twist I have ever seen &amp; encountered.,2014-06-21T09:47:00Z
CoryxKenshin,The writing for this game was perfection.,2015-09-12T05:24:37Z
CoryxKenshin,I really liked the twisted ending because it adds more twist to the story. This game is a 10-10! Can&#39;t get better.,2015-08-24T07:24:34Z
CoryxKenshin,This is one of the best games i have ever played :0 its awesome,2014-07-30T18:18:57Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Was that good acting?&quot; That killed me. x&#39;D,2015-05-24T15:16:26Z
CoryxKenshin,"This game remind me so much of Stanley´s Parallel. Love the dialogue, the voice acting and the puzzles were so much fun even to just watch. Very creative and original.",2014-08-19T21:02:18Z
CoryxKenshin,I love this guys videos because he doesn&#39;t talk during the fucking dialogue! :)<br> ,2014-09-05T03:06:45Z
CoryxKenshin,"so I just finished the game and wanted to see if there was any videos on it, stumbled across this and wanted to clarify: <b>SPOILER ALERT BELOW DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING RUINED</b><br><br><br>Basically Vinny is Sam&#39;s godfather, there was a third speaker that was projecting the voice of her real dad, Stephano, who is the guy Vinny talks to in the windmill, now I cant really explain the game itself too much but from what I gather it was all kind of a... a parallel to what was actually going on, the breaking of pots, is (from what I thought) you getting high at the party, like I said I cant really explain the whole windmill and the clocks and door thing too much or even the park but what I said is what I understood, apparently Vinny was drugging the guys at the party who were trying to hook up with Sam and Anthony was one of those guys (seeing as how he didnt know) the game itself is supposed to be that drug trip, however it shows you what happened that night in parallel as I said earlier... maybe I&#39;m wrong but idk this is what I thought of the plot.",2014-07-28T05:48:22Z
CoryxKenshin,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1LI9DH8K-o&amp;t=15m23s"">15:23</a> Best part. xD  Made me laugh so much! What a strange concept, but it turned out amazing. Such a mind blowing and unexpected game.",2014-06-22T19:07:21Z
CoryxKenshin,The game was so confusing that the plot twist didn’t even phase me 😂😭 I hope the next episode makes more sense,2022-05-16T12:19:25Z
CoryxKenshin,&quot;Ok so i shot this part already&quot;<br>Me: looks at gun,2014-06-20T22:17:53Z
CoryxKenshin,The graphics of this game is amazing :D this hard part of the game reminds me of the time I was playing prototype 2 and the boss battle at the end was really difficult and annoying haha XD,2014-06-29T05:40:59Z
CoryxKenshin,"LOL!! Even if I didn&#39;t love this game, this is the most awesome walkthru evar!<br><br>One thing to note... in the level &#39;Blind&#39; (with the slot machine), if you don&#39;t break it or push it, you end up getting stuck in a maze &#39;sacrificing&#39; pawns until you &#39;die&#39; and the level starts all over again. And you can get to the level &#39;windmill&#39; (which is where you go if you sacrifice Sam) but I can&#39;t figure out how to get out of it.<br><br>Amazing review and walkthru.",2015-03-11T17:19:47Z
CoryxKenshin,I admire your patience in playing that and your restraint in not cussing!,2014-11-30T11:33:19Z

CoryxKenshin,Best game I play on PC can&#39;t wait for more games like this. I love the music too reminds me of my good man flying lotus ,2014-08-14T05:55:13Z
CoryxKenshin,Oh my gosh! That was great! Mind=blown. So much work just so you wouldn&#39;t have relations with your sister. That was fricken awesome.,2014-06-21T00:19:08Z

CoryxKenshin,This game is a mad trip 😆,2017-11-07T05:34:35Z
CoryxKenshin,"Oooh, Anthony, you defini--- I can&#39;t believe I felt an impulse to call you Anthony, haha-- you definitely must play <b>The Stanley Parable</b>, to me, <b>that</b> would be the first game I&#39;d truly call part of an 8th artform. It cleverly makes you notice what&#39;s interactivity&#39;s place in storytelling, and in a much funnier experience than this one.<br>Speaking of it: <b>WHAT?</b> Look... I just won&#39;t praise this because there&#39;s a difference between leaving <i>loose ends</i> in your story and just leaving freakin&#39; <i>holes</i> ! And I think this one is just a hole after another that they didn&#39;t bother to fill xD<br>Anyway, I enjoyed you, bro!",2015-01-14T22:46:55Z
CoryxKenshin,"This was the first series I watch of CoryxKenshin!! Back in 2013... (13,000)",2018-06-07T03:59:16Z
CoryxKenshin,Okay so here&#39;s my take: At some point during the party he was drugged and so while drugged he goes through this trip that helps him sort through these memories that helps him realize/remember that the girl he wants to sleep with is in fact his sister? o_o....O_O.... <b>brainsplosion</b> Damn that&#39;s nuts. Straight up insane. Awesome play through Cory XD. Hey you know what&#39;d be fun? Corpse Party! :D,2014-06-21T03:34:56Z
CoryxKenshin,You should do gameplay of the alternate story! When you choose the door to save yourself instead of her. It&#39;s just as strange... Hehe.,2014-10-22T05:12:39Z
CoryxKenshin,the first part with him jumping from high heights were making me really nervous,2016-10-26T02:46:35Z

CoryxKenshin,"Ahhhh Nostalgia.  This was literally the video that made me find Coryxkenshin, then after this series i went on to watch one night at flumptys two, then five nights at warios. I fell in love with his recording style, his comedy, his editing, and the fact that he never curses. I just am so happy that one day i looked up &#39;Chum bucket wants my krabby patty&#39; xD",2016-12-26T00:57:03Z
CoryxKenshin,These are the types of Corey videos that I wish we could get back.,2022-09-03T15:38:19Z

CoryxKenshin,"even its 2020 watching this, this game is still good to watch by cory",2020-10-31T18:43:31Z
CoryxKenshin,"You need to press the overdrive button when one of the animatronics gets close to the generator in the basement. The animatronic basically shuts down your generator, knocking out all of the power.",2015-05-13T01:13:52Z
CoryxKenshin,Cory: Who the freak is that<br>Me: Well that&#39;s...<br>Cory: Is that a star or something<br>Patrick: No this is Patrick,2018-01-01T18:08:45Z
CoryxKenshin,"This is gonna be a good game, I can tell already. I wish I could give you some tips, though, Cory! I&#39;m gonna research the game later and hopefully come up with something to help you. :D",2015-05-13T01:04:59Z

CoryxKenshin,"Cory, this is what you need to do. Up the brightness in the options first. The reason your lights went out? Check the generator ever so often... the extra rooms are important. Also very important as well, when you turn your flashlight on and check the hallways, it is easier to see the aminitronics looking at your door. Plus that robot that kept killing you? That was Karen ;).",2015-05-13T01:09:58Z
CoryxKenshin,I love your videos Cory Kenshin they&#39;re so funny and you&#39;re so hilarious when you make things sounds so scary when you playing other scary games keep up the good work man.:),2015-12-01T06:51:05Z
CoryxKenshin,I have come here to absorb the Cory memories hope he comes back 😢✊,2021-06-12T03:02:05Z
CoryxKenshin,Coming back to watch this after 5 years and it’s still better than ever<br><br>I’m not sure if others are watching this with me at the moment but if you guys are then either 1. You came back to watch Cory’s old videos cause they bring back so many memories. Or 2. Your new and trying to see what videos Cory used to make,2020-07-15T22:03:11Z
CoryxKenshin,Nothing like watching Cory get scared by a kid show,2015-12-23T21:56:23Z
CoryxKenshin,And this video was the first video I found of Cory. Since 2015 Cory love you!❤,2022-01-17T00:01:57Z
CoryxKenshin,"This game is so scary. All except for the creepy guy on the phone. He tried a southern accent immitation, but wasn&#39;t very good at it, and then kinda navigated away from it. That was pretty funny. The twist on the doors are pretty cool, though. There&#39;s unlimited power, but limited use of the power. And, stuff can overheat. Scary.",2015-12-31T05:00:59Z
CoryxKenshin,"Cory,You are a complete pro at these FNAF games.And that&#39;s a good thing.",2017-11-26T19:20:11Z

CoryxKenshin,This is such a brutal version of the FNAF series,2015-11-27T22:47:26Z
CoryxKenshin,This game looks very well done,2015-05-14T00:24:07Z
CoryxKenshin,It&#39;s about time I&#39;ve seen you slashing through these games how&#39;s it going?😃,2015-05-17T23:53:58Z

CoryxKenshin,who else here after the new one came out?👀 hopefully Cory gets the time to play this again :),2022-05-10T19:21:18Z
CoryxKenshin,I Really Like your reactions to jumpscares! Keep the Good Work Man!<br>(its 2017 in my country do you have new videos),2017-01-07T21:29:56Z
CoryxKenshin,"You&#39;re suppose to keep an eye on the generators, one of the animatronics goes down there to mess with them and it cuts off the power then kills you. You keep an eye on the generators and press the red button to chase it away from them. And yes, would love to see a part 2! :D",2015-05-13T03:06:16Z
CoryxKenshin,"Something to take notice is that at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W839UJrunuk&amp;t=6m44s"">6:44</a> SpongeBob does the jumpscare however he isn’t in the player’s face. He is instead at the door doing that jumpscare.",2023-03-14T18:05:03Z

CoryxKenshin,Them good days.. I LOVED THIS  😍😍,2018-03-04T23:42:46Z
CoryxKenshin,"I believe that&#39;s Sandy killing you; she makes inventions and things, so that would make sense that she&#39;s fiddling with the generator&#39;s mechanics. When the lights are flickering like that, I believe you have to use overdrive, even though you&#39;ll only be allowed to use one piece of equipment once it&#39;s run out for a while. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re playing it though! It&#39;s so good~<br>if you want to know who comes through the vents, I&#39;ll let you know after the break here<br>-

CoryxKenshin,"I love how that box decided to moonwalk across the screen and Cory didn&#39;t notice it loool. Oh, and try building a cabin! Or making medicine if that&#39;s possible yet (I&#39;m not sure)",2014-09-01T21:17:49Z

GeorgeNotFound,"Actually, all the video, I felt like George was the most honest person ever from all the participants (he didn&#39;t punch, didn&#39;t scare any of them). In the plane, George actually had worse seat then another ones. George is the one, who actually tries to figure out where they are flying, using the compass (everyone was just looking through the window 🤷🏻) and his knowledge of geography (you gonna be a good teacher, George 😉). No one actually put him up to the team, and he tried to made us sure about he&#39;s alright. When there were red lines, George&#39;s one was the hardest (actually was almost the level of his maximum; and the other ones had some space to move the finger down). Actually, I keep forgetting how to breath all the video, cause i was pretty sure, George gonna make it in his honest way. It was so heartbreaking prank in the end, but it was as heartbreaking as seeing George&#39;s reaction of 16 hours doing this so hard and as the result have nothing :(<br><br>One of the great moments was the way how Nolan tried to wear a hoodie with George ( it&#39;s almost melt my heart ☺️💔). And, you know George, you should wear that hoodie ☺️😉, of course knowing all the future before doing it.<br><br>We so proud of you, George.

I also remember thinking that Dream was being rude, and I also watched the video where he was a parrot afterward. At that point, my mind was already made up that Dream was being a jerk to George, but as I watched more, I realized that I actually liked watching these kinds of videos. So, over a year later, I still watch them and a huge fan of the SMP and all the amazing people in the community (of course, not the toxic side). I&#39;m so happy that I actually stayed though, 2021 has been one of the happiest years of my life. All of these laughs and new content never fail to make me smile. Getting my first merch from Bad&#39;s shop, watching streams back-to-back while late at night, and showing some of the members to my sisters and them enjoying them, and noticing people at my new school wearing some merch has made me so happy. I honestly can&#39;t thank you enough with this video, George :) I can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s been so long in such a short amount of time :,)",2022-01-30T21:16:20Z

iHasCupquake,A game you may like since I believe you liked Animal Crossing is Dinkum. Its really fun and its basically Animal Crossing on PC. Once youve done the most you can do in the game at this point in time there are helpful mods you can look into as well.,2022-08-30T00:43:48Z
iHasCupquake,I&#39;m so glad I can speak on this now so the theory that&#39;s going around because of B-12 is the fact that the companion bots are probably humans uploaded into the machines. I was waiting for you to discover this first before I said anything,2022-08-27T18:43:25Z

iHasCupquake,That dude was blackout drunk though you saw him sleeping on table. Shame you had to dash some bottles on top of him but I suppose you have to wake him up somehow. that would be quite the wake Up call if you ask me and I&#39;ve never even drank. You could have dropped one bottle on the floor and I would have heard it if I was in that state.,2022-08-27T19:25:16Z

iHasCupquake,Cupcake&#39;s Diy are the best 😍,2016-10-07T19:28:56Z
iHasCupquake,"A suggestion might be to use the fabric for the entire black part of the eye instead of only a small part. The real eye holes were very noticeable, and it was hard to see this as a shy guy unless i squinted to make the darker eye dots &quot;disappear&quot;. If the reason for this is because the eyes wont be rounded, i don&#39;t think that&#39;s much of a problem. If it is, then use very small holed plastic canvas and color that black with some spray paint or something. (Acrylic paint clogs up the holes more easily.) Just an idea for anyone who plans on doing this DIY! Amazing as always Cupquake~",2016-10-07T19:34:50Z

MegMage,Monster Deck is just visually formidable just use the Frostbite Weather Card all the close range Devils of the opponent will be ineffective. Use it during Closing the round as the opponent might use a counter Clear weather Card.,2022-06-11T16:12:31Z

MegMage,"Nilfgaard itself isn&#39;t that great but I have to admit I really like General Voorhis, everytime Geralt meets him in game he&#39;s always just really respectful and friendly, even considering he and Geralt friends, I&#39;m glad they kept him wholesome pretty much and you didn&#39;t have to like end up killing him in a quest or anything.",2022-10-14T02:50:58Z

MegMage,"I don’t want to add more fuel to the fire buuut yeah I feel like she actually just acted drunk to try and get Geralt to let his guard down. I mean, she seems to get over it rather quickly when the guy shows up, or when you refuse to kiss her. On the positive side she wasn’t using magic this time or taking advantage of his amnesia to convince him that she was his true love so its not the worst thing she’s done :ppp",2022-06-11T17:51:52Z
MegMage,"So i&#39;m replaying this also atm, great game innit?   -  This time around, i&#39;ve decided to put my Geralt with Triss in this play-thru, and I&#39;ll break off instead of locking-in with Yen as I go through Skellige.  TBH, as much as there is that natural spark/attraction with Yen, she seems a bit sly/underhand/self centred/overly-political.   SO atm i&#39;m thinking Triss might make for the healthier long-term commitment.",2022-06-12T00:12:54Z

MegMage,"This whole quest and the mages trapped in Novigrad is probably the biggest plot hole of the W3. Why wouldn&#39;t the mages just teleport out of the city? IDK if it&#39;s mentioned anywhere but it feels like because they needed someone to for Triss to rescue but only had the most powerful people in the north,  so they stripped them of their power.",2022-06-12T17:56:10Z

MegMage,This game is so freaking good. Thank you for encouraging me to keep playing! It is so complex and nuanced. Love you all so much and hope you&#39;re doing well today. ❤,2022-03-19T15:58:38Z
MegMage,"This cutscene is very important and helps us understand Cole better. Remember, Cole was always presented as this war hero, and now we know the truth: he was no hero. He only got that medal because he happened to be the only survivor of that battle. Phelps is traumatized, and he feels he didn‘t deserve the medal. He has survivor‘s guilt. That’s why he doesn’t talk about the war and why he tries to atone through his work as a detective. But there‘s a lot more about his past you‘ve yet to find out.<br><br>I won‘t spoil it, but the next mission is the climax, and things will happen and be revealed that will surprise you and make you see Phelps in a whole new light. Many people who are on their first playthrough are often quite shocked and confused, but keep at it and it will all make sense once the full story unfolds during the following cases.",2022-03-19T18:14:05Z
MegMage,"I really enjoy this part of the story because it shows how Cole went to war with the mentality of making a name for himself, but after his friends and squad got killed and he got his silver medal, he hates it because he feels that he didn&#39;t deserve it. Kelso&#39;s line about their job being to die for your future really hits Phelps right there.",2022-03-19T21:18:01Z
MegMage,Cole asking Roy to drive to the police station that they were next to is like when a customer demands to speak to the manager and they already are.,2022-03-24T07:31:03Z
MegMage,"This is the best case. Feels like the pinnacle of LA Noire with it being the most ‘Hollywood’ case in the game, full of twists and all these other fun elements. There’s a bit of interrogating, chasing, tailing, etc.<br><br>Cole is at the top of his detective game here too, Roy is least sufferable in this case compared to others, you work with your old partners, etc.",2022-06-20T03:12:15Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJniOTKbTKo&amp;t=35m08s"">35:08</a> &quot;We&#39;re already here, Cole! WTH! Are you high??!!&quot; 🤣🤣🤣",2022-03-19T18:57:05Z
MegMage,"The discussion where Phelps and Earl talk about the former partners is funny.  I personally disliked Galloway (Rusty/Finbar) at first, because of all the crude remarks he would make, especially about his ex-wives and general anti-woman attitude.  I still don&#39;t exactly like Galloway but, with time, you got to see there was a bit of softer side underneath the jaded cynic that peeked out from time to time.  It made me at least have some sympathy towards Galloway.  Whereas, in comparison, Earl never seems to have anything but cynical self-centred motivations to him.  It makes him very unsympathetic.",2022-04-15T16:56:41Z
MegMage,"Hey Meg, loved the walkthrough, when you were at the apartment building, you could have found morphine syrettes in the trash and in a plant in the building, that’s why Mal asked you to look around the building to see if you could find any syrettes to prove his theory.",2022-11-09T18:36:59Z

MegMage,The face when you spotted the word Templar is the kind of reaction that makes first time playthroughs of this game so great,2023-03-20T00:56:35Z
MegMage,"Everybody got trolled by Haytham, even Desmond himself.",2023-03-20T03:02:34Z
MegMage,Haytham converted many AC fans from Assassins to Templars,2023-03-20T07:15:22Z
MegMage,"“Wait, what?!”<br>-Desmond Miles",2023-03-20T01:38:19Z
MegMage,What I find hilarious about the templars creed especially the “ and never share our secrets” is that every time you kill a Templar in any of the games they immediately tell you everything 😂😂,2023-03-20T22:50:05Z
MegMage,"Meg, I freaking love your reactions 😂 I did the exact same thing. I was so sus of Haytham the entire time, and then it was revealed and it was like 🤯",2023-03-20T03:11:31Z
MegMage,This was actually a good scene. The first time that made you think maybe templars weren&#39;t all just bad/corrupt people.,2023-04-27T04:38:13Z
MegMage,"Desmond Miles has walked a thousand miles, and yet again he deserved a Game of the Year Award.",2023-04-10T05:49:56Z
MegMage,Curious how Meg will deal with Rogue,2023-03-20T15:59:05Z
MegMage,It seems to be no word to discuss on what just happened till hearing Desmond say “Wait..What?”,2023-03-20T01:00:56Z
MegMage,that was my reaction years back i was also laughing 🤣,2023-03-20T21:08:46Z
MegMage,I played this years ago and still to this day the utter betrayal I felt. After dying so many time during gameplay with this man just to find out he’s a freakin Templar 😂😂😂😂,2023-04-02T00:59:15Z
MegMage,Hahah meg your reactions are the best😂😂. This moment was shocking for everyone!,2023-03-20T05:35:37Z
MegMage,"I must say that I was spoiled about Haytham being a templar and that he would fight Connor, but I still got shocked because I thougth he got turned during the game",2023-03-20T12:11:26Z
MegMage,Its okay Meg your still my hero.😇❤,2023-05-13T00:45:07Z
MegMage,"Back in the days when the game was first released, there was an achievement you get after completing this sequence which said “how do you like them apples?”. Ubisoft played with our emotions that day 😂",2023-05-31T19:25:13Z
MegMage,Literally how we all felt lmao😂,2023-03-20T23:02:47Z

MegMage,"I knew it, they were engaged!",2023-05-31T04:01:56Z
MegMage,I could tell we were templars when they were calling it an order and not a creed throughout the entire beginning of the game,2023-06-09T20:14:23Z
MegMage,You are a Templar ✝️💍🧐<br>~ May the Father of understanding guide you sister!,2023-07-11T07:22:36Z

MegMage,"This is why as much as I use them, I hate subtitles. You can&#39;t spoil a line like that before you hear it. I wish subtitles would appear as the word is being said, not before. It would really add to the moment.",2023-03-20T02:35:42Z
MegMage,Lol you got fooled,2023-03-21T02:56:54Z
MegMage,Great example why subtitles suuuuck,2023-05-25T16:40:08Z
MegMage,"IMO the cutscene where Eagle Flies comes to Arthur and Dutch for help with the horses was one of the times where I REALLY hated Dutch. It a self serving act disguised as an act of altruism.<br>He sees an angry young man who is on the edge and all he needs is a little push to create chaos for Dutch. Dutch senses this and preys on it. He&#39;s such a scumbag that he even tells EF to put his money away as if he&#39;s doing this out of the kindness of his heart.<br><br> I&#39;m left to wonder if Arthur in this moment looked back at his childhood when he first met Dutch and saw himself in Eagle Flies, and it infuriated him as he was used just like Dutch uses this poor kid. <br><br>This was one of the cutscenes that really made me angry at Dutch. Sacrificing an entire tribe who has already been through enough hardship just to give him a chance to escape?? Total prick.",2021-05-20T23:46:18Z
MegMage,I really like your streams MegMage!! I am your fan UwU,2021-01-18T22:28:31Z

MegMage,"Hi Princess I mean Meghan :-))<br>now it is not long now and you have reached the end of the journey. It makes me a bit sad but I still enjoy every episode to the end. I wish you a lot of fun playing on, have a nice weekend and lovely greetings to you and your sweet Yuna. <br>Too bad you didn&#39;t examine Benson&#39;s bedroom, then you would have seen what perverted things he still does",2022-04-14T21:05:00Z
MegMage,I love this game. Finished it a long time ago. But you’ve also missed searching the rest of Benson’s apartment at the beginning of your video. You won’t like what nasty man was doing.,2022-04-14T15:28:36Z
MegMage,"Yay! Monroe finally got what he deserved! He‘s the number 1 Big Bad, and the mastermind behind the whole Suburban Redevelopment Fund conspiracy (that actually goes even further than you now think - you‘ll soon find out). Unfortunately, you still have to deal with Big Bad number 2 (Dr Fontaine, who is voiced by Peter Blomquist aka Micah Bell !) and the guy who starts the fires.<br><br>You did miss a very disturbing scene, tho. In Curtis Benson‘s house, you could have gone into the bedroom. There, you would have found a naked 12 year old girl in his bed. Makes you want to punch him a few more times.<br><br>And yes, Roy Earle signed that report. Roy is also involved in the Suburban Redevelopment Fund (no surprise there!). But Roy is probably also trying to blackmail Fontaine and possibly Monroe.<br><br>The next case is the final DLC case, which you play as Cole and which takes place at the same time as this one (that’s why Cole didn‘t join in the attack). After that, we‘ll get to the grand finale.",2022-04-14T16:33:53Z

MegMage,Luckily you didn&#39;t search his bedroom,2022-08-11T12:41:56Z
MegMage,"No connection between Kelso and Jack Marston. Jack Marston was born in 1895, so by 1947 he’d be 52 and thus would have been too old to have served in WW2 like Kelso did.",2022-04-15T01:13:47Z

MegMage,"Oh and yeah Begins and Dark Knight were adored for some great comic book/Animated series refs at the time. We hadn&#39;t seen them depicted on the Silver Screen in a while. Especially not this way... Love that having <b>some</b> context made ya teary, Meg; Lovely to see this Universe start to mean as much to someone &#39;&#39;new&#39;&#39; as it does to us &lt;3",2023-01-05T07:56:33Z
MegMage,"Michael Caine&#39;s Alfred, Morgan Freeman&#39;s Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman&#39;s Gordon etc.<br>The support cast of this trilogy was on a different level.",2023-01-05T21:09:42Z
MegMage,This trilogy and The Batman are phenomenal films,2023-01-05T18:09:42Z
MegMage,"To quote the movies… “And… here… we… go.”<br><br>THIS is going to be so much fun. My smile is so ludicrously big. I will be a Superman fan until my dying day, but this take on Batman is so awesome, I cannot help but be a fan of it. Enjoy!",2023-01-05T17:51:38Z
MegMage,"Rachel is a love interest that Nolan made up for the trilogy, which is why you don’t recognize her. But I wouldn’t say she’s just a “random girl”, but you’ll see when you watch them. I assume Nolan chose to avoid any pre-established love interest to keep comic fans on their toes. Also to keep them focused on the movie that’s in front of their face instead of on comparing it to the comics or theorizing on future events.",2023-01-05T23:31:24Z
MegMage,"I just love watching u react , I’ve watched tons off ppl become Batman fans after reacting to this trilogy , watching u react is such amazing experience",2023-02-01T21:29:37Z
MegMage,"Can&#39;t wait to see you guys react to them! It&#39;s crazy seeing how many amazing actors they have in these films considering how large the cast is, truly iconic trilogy",2023-01-05T19:26:42Z
MegMage,Oooooh so excited for a reaction to this trilogy. Love your guys’ film reactions.,2023-01-05T18:21:50Z
MegMage,"Watching the Dark Knight&#39;s trailer back  all these years later, they really did a great job at hiding the awesomeness of Ledger&#39;s performance.",2023-01-05T21:16:14Z
MegMage,"This trilogy set the bar for DC live action.  Hopefully Matt Reeves can keep up, The Batman is now my 3rd favorite Batman film behind The Dark Knight and Tim Burton&#39;s 89 classic.",2023-01-05T20:01:12Z
MegMage,&quot;The Batman&quot; by Matt Reeves was incredible too,2023-01-05T23:35:42Z
MegMage,I was 10 when begins came out. I was a huge Batman fan but I’d never seen any of them in the cinema. Just the original 4 on VHS and the animated series on tv. I remember first seeing the poster for begins in the cinema window as I walked past. I couldn’t believe a batman movie was going to be in the cinema. The Nolan trilogy has a very special place in my heart. I also adored Matt reeves the batman last year,2023-01-05T22:34:29Z
MegMage,Watching you as a non fan then become a Batman fan was a joyful experience.,2023-01-08T17:10:16Z
MegMage,"Not gonna lie, very excited to see you react to this trilogy.💯",2023-01-05T18:07:57Z
MegMage,"Rachel is most-likely a variation on Vicki Vale.  They were going for hard “realism” with these movies.  Essentially, what would these characters look and sound like if they existed in the real, “grounded” world?  Meanwhile, DC Comics has always had a thing for alliterative names.  “Lex Luthor,” “Lois Lane,” “Lana Lang,” “Clark Kent,” et cetera.  “Vicki Vale” was probably a bit too on-the-nose for Nolan and company, so she became “Rachel Dawes,” a name that sounds more like the name of someone you’d randomly meet in the real world.  Rachel’s role as “ADA that Batman helps” in “Batman Begins” was originally meant to be Harvey Dent, before they decided to save Harvey for later, since it was just a glorified cameo.  So they combined that character with the “love interest” character, making both roles much-more fleshed-out, as they were now one person, with more cumulative screentime than either character would have had individually.  This follows Rachel being an expy for Vicki, since, in the comics, Vicki is a long-time on-again, off-again girlfriend to Bruce, and a journalist, rather than a lawyer, so, close enough?",2023-01-05T17:21:18Z
MegMage,"Frankly starting with the animated stuff is probably the best way to start. Some of the best stuff is the animated ones, like The Dark Knight Returns.  Hell, one of the best Batman versions comes from a Flash movie",2023-01-07T14:12:45Z
MegMage,Have you not seen the Batman quadrilogy from 1989 to 1997? You need to watch those movies to understand how and why the Nolan Trilogy is so important to Batman&#39;s film history.,2023-01-05T17:08:07Z
MegMage,These are honestly my favourite films of all time. Please watch them. It’s one of Cillian Murphy’s first big roles :),2023-01-05T17:13:29Z
MegMage,We all would love if you reacted to the Tim Burton Batman films.,2023-01-05T17:28:15Z
MegMage,Love this trilogy! Right next to planet of the apes for me and Heath licked his lips a lot cause of the make up it kept coming off so they just had that be a thing his character did,2023-01-05T07:39:22Z
MegMage,Please watch the trilogy Meg! 😊,2023-01-05T17:13:06Z
MegMage,"There&#39;s one thing that I never see people talk about with Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker: how the make-up ages him. When he filmed it, he was in his mid-to-late twenties, but he looks almost 60.",2023-01-05T17:57:10Z
MegMage,My favorite film of all time.  Can&#39;t wait.,2023-01-06T14:46:33Z
MegMage,The Nolan trilogy was made to be a more real world take on the Batman mythos. So there isn&#39;t much in terms of supernatural and sci-fi characters like superpowers and stuff.,2023-01-05T21:20:46Z
MegMage,Would love to see you react to the original Tim Burton Batman movie from 1989 starring Michael Keaton,2023-01-06T09:39:48Z
MegMage,It’s a shock as an Irish person to here someone from the US pronounce Cillian Murphy’s name right,2023-01-05T18:27:42Z
MegMage,These trailers still give me hype,2023-01-05T16:58:15Z
MegMage,"The Dark Knight- the best Joker hands down in a live action film! RIP Heath Ledger, that role overtook him unfortunately but he left us with a beautiful piece of work ! Great reactions !",2023-01-06T05:48:19Z
MegMage,Ahh man I&#39;m so excited for you to get into the Nolan Live Action Batman movies!,2023-01-05T15:12:44Z
MegMage,now i need a reaction video to this movie😄,2023-01-05T17:23:14Z
MegMage,"I was not expecting you guys to react to the trailers for these but hey anytime you guys react to anything DC or Marvel related I&#39;m all here for. I can&#39;t wait for when you eventually react to the Nolan trilogy. I absolutely love how hyped you were getting while watching these. And you being like, &quot;WHO THE FUCK IS RACHEL?!&quot; I don&#39;t blame you since I personally never cared much for her in these movies either. Also unrelated to the Nolan trilogy, but I also hope you guys rewatch Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman movie with the deleted Joker scene since I think you guys said you haven&#39;t seen it yet. Of course that&#39;s for future stuff so no rush if you guys do plan on doing a rewatch. But thanks for this unexpected reaction!",2023-01-05T07:42:15Z
MegMage,FFS now I wanna watch this trilogy again for the 100th time,2023-01-07T12:54:25Z
MegMage,"Eventually you need to watch the Michael Keaton batman movies from 1989 and 1992 it&#39;s my favorite live action Batman highly recommend. p.s, those movies inspired the animated series.",2023-01-06T01:03:17Z
MegMage,"&quot;It has Scarecrow&#39;s horse?!&quot; Yeah they wanted Scarecrow, but he costed too much, so they only got his horse for the movie haha",2023-01-05T20:26:55Z
MegMage,You should also watch Dark knight returns. It’s about old Bruce,2023-01-05T17:17:41Z
MegMage,Turns out that Joker &quot;improvised&quot; detonator scene wasn&#39;t actually improvised it was actually scripted.,2023-01-05T19:38:12Z
MegMage,"On ur journey u should react to the other Batman live action films too like Batman 89, Batman Returns, and Batman vs Superman and maybe a rewatch of The Batman",2023-01-06T03:18:19Z
MegMage,"Well… it’s too late to say this, but TDKR trailer has at least two spoilers about TDK. <br>I don’t think they’re all that noticeable until you watch TDK though, so it probably won’t matter.",2023-01-05T17:51:55Z
MegMage,The only batman film that is anything like the animated series is Matt Reeves The Batman. Nolan made batman too realistic and Snyder made batman a killer. The only batman that stay honestly true to both the comics and the animated series is Robert Pattinson,2023-01-06T18:24:30Z
MegMage,Highly recommend watching Gotham (DC Show) the way they did joker is crazy,2023-01-05T18:30:42Z
MegMage,"Begins is eh, but still kinda good (was def great at the time, and still has some iconic moments). Dark Knight is still great, though fairly laggy in parts. Rises......................------ <br><br>The Batman was epic and <b>finally</b> dethroned Nolan as definitive Silver Screen Bats rep., and I was so glad for it. <b>Cannot wait</b> to see what R-Patts does with Bruce/Bats in the 2024 Sequel, since it&#39;ll most likely be set a few years later in Universe as well (hopefully). Animated Series Bats/the entire DCAU remains <b>peak</b> , <b>untouchable</b> DC though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",2023-01-05T07:44:45Z
MegMage,The creators of Ra’s Al ghul said that he was meant to look racially ambiguous. I prefer the ra’s in the show Gotham and the show arrow over Liam neeson,2023-01-21T22:27:01Z
MegMage,The best film Trilogy ever,2023-01-05T16:58:02Z
MegMage,"hey MegMage are you going to do reactions to all the live action Batman movies? (Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman &amp; Robin, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, The Batman)",2023-01-05T18:09:17Z
MegMage,There are Movie Stars<br>Then there are Actors<br>Then there is Christian Bale.,2023-01-06T01:55:25Z
MegMage,Have you not seen Batman 1989? That is what the animated series was based on,2023-01-06T04:10:28Z
MegMage,"I&#39;ve seen so many reactions I swear I saw yours to the trilogy already 🤣 if you are a fan of Cillian Murphy, you should watch the film Sunshine if you havent seen it!",2023-01-05T18:02:54Z
MegMage,"I just love that moment where Atreus just bumps into Kratos from behind and he ends up grappling onto his shoulder finally. Despite Kratos knowing he isn’t ready for that type of embrace yet, he still lets the moment pass.",2022-11-05T16:01:59Z
MegMage,"Hello Meg and welcome back again. Wow two GoW Episodes in a row you are amazing. I&#39;ve now started Gow again because I want to see if I can finish it by Ragnarok. I&#39;m so excited to see how our &quot;Boy&quot; has changed. Also how things will continue with Freya and the others and how long she will be angry with us or if she might get together with Odin again to take Revenge against Kratos?! 🤔Oh yes, I can hardly wait, but until then have a nice Monday, have fun playing, Happy Halloween and lovely Greetings to the four of you <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a><a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",2022-10-31T09:54:23Z
MegMage,"Hi, Meg! I&#39;m writing this without finishing the video so I don&#39;t know if you discover later, but the man Kratos knew that told stories is Aesop! He probably told Kratos his famous Fables!",2022-11-05T16:53:35Z
MegMage,That was a great fight in that game,2022-11-05T15:02:39Z
MegMage,"Kratos: What did you write?<br>Atreus: I asked them to watch over mother. Do you think they&#39;ll watch over us on the way to the top?<br>Kratos: Maybe if you had written that on the lantern too, boy! 😠",2022-11-06T05:34:27Z

All he has to do is <i>be there</i> , and the Assassins are like &quot;aight, our boy&#39;s back, lez do this&quot;.<br><br>Edit: the saddest thing about Abbas... is that there <i>is</i> no afterlife.

MegMage,That scene where Ezio leaves the harbor is 1 of the best and was awesome to see as the gameplay piece for e3 for it 💘,2023-03-03T21:47:44Z
MegMage,The setting sail mission was right from the revelations demo,2023-02-26T18:32:14Z
MegMage,Make sure to watch Lost Archive on YouTube or something. It’s a DLC for Revelations and touches on 16’s story much like Desmonds.,2023-02-26T17:56:59Z
MegMage,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0G2aPdrrPQ&amp;t=21m40s"">21:40</a> It&#39;s because Ezio, Altaїr and Desmond had the same face actor",2023-06-22T17:05:19Z

MegMage,RDR 1 and 2 both are great Games but their Endings are brutal 😭,2021-04-03T17:17:28Z
MegMage,I feel like John&#39;s death is more sadder than Arthur&#39;s death. John&#39;s death was unexpected and him struggling to breath with bullets inside his body as he slowly dies making it more harder to watch. It was just pure silence then he just falls and dies.,2022-01-08T08:43:50Z
MegMage,"Gosh, this ending is so brutal. 😔 A day later, I still can&#39;t stop thinking about this and all the discussions we had in stream about it.",2021-04-03T17:09:56Z
MegMage,"Very interesting is that when you see Ross group leaving after killing John. U don&#39;t see Fordham at all. My guess is that he didn&#39;t wanna partake in this massacre because he knows John honor his agreement with them by getting rid of dutch, bill, and Javier. He might not like Ross idea to do this at all.",2021-09-02T04:05:50Z

MegMage,I love this game when I first played it in still do now. After my very first playthrough where John dies every other time I play the game I never finish the final level. One reason is because John Marston is the best in my opinion and should never Die . The second reason is I hate adult Jack. When John dies I like to imagine his is spirit ghosts wakes up in the first thing he sees is his dead body then Arthur shows up welcomes John to Heaven. For all the good members of the gang are there,2023-05-11T15:43:22Z

MegMage,I love Legion. He&#39;s an amazing character. So well written (And it&#39;s so funny to do Tali&#39;s loyalty mission with Legion on the team. The Quarians flip their shit),2021-07-28T22:31:31Z
MegMage,"<b>acquires an intact geth, has a key to any knowledge about the geth and synthetic life in general</b><br><br>&quot;Does it have a peepee?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;M DEAD XD XD XD",2021-07-27T16:30:19Z
MegMage,"I&#39;m really glad to see you&#39;ve taken a shine to my absolute favourite character in the series ^^ Legion is really special as far as the geth go, and you might have noticed that parts of their head were making motions while they was talking. Their &quot;body&quot; was specifically designed for interacting with organic life (hence how they can hold 1,183 geth programs as opposed to the average 100), so the mobile platform is actually attempting to mimic facial expressions ^^ Its a nice little touch",2021-07-27T17:00:55Z

MegMage,"If you hang around Legion long enough he&#39;ll start to dance. Something similar happens with Joker in the cockpit.

alliebeemac,"To get the ground Dash you need to go to an optional area back near where you started.  The game won&#39;t ever tell you to go there, you just need to go exploring to find it.",2017-09-17T21:45:41Z
alliebeemac,go back to the first spirit well and then climb the wall to the right. while that is the optional area it is where the dash ability is and one more ability is that is needed for a bunch of not quite side areas but optional rewards on the main paths.,2017-09-25T21:22:34Z

alliebeemac,You get the Dash Ability in the Black Root Burrows. Detail: it is a bonus area. Detail 2: It is hard. I Say it is harder than Mount Horu itself.,2017-10-30T02:26:36Z
alliebeemac,"AKA you are a Ninja!<br><br>and yes totally ori should get magic girl outfits.... you do know there is a code to change ori&#39;s color. Left, Up, Right, Down, Up, Up, Up, [Jump]. It&#39;s a lot of fun. also if you can get a controller hooked up to your com it will make a lot of the crazy jump sections WAY easier and less hand cramping. (using my PS4 controller myself)<br><br>Ori is a light spirit. A mix of momo/stich/cat/and the soul of cuteness in physical forum.<br><br>Hello Kuro big scary owl with much story importance.<br><br>Also the tree while being alive since it&#39;s a tree it is not sentient like the tree of life. Also Sein said &quot;The Water&#39;s FLOW&quot; thourhgt it so you just turned the tap back on but since it had a bunch of gunk in it that needed to be flushed out you got chased by the cleaning/boot up the flow systems is my theory.<br><br>As for the Dash Ability Head back to the first save point you found after the very start of the game and climb the wall to go to the area where the ability can be found. there are technically 2 skills in the area but the second one you need to have yet another skill to reach even deeper into that area. It will be tricky as all of Ori is but follow the light will help you.<br><br>Keep up the good work... just get more sleep first next time that also helps.<br><br>Sad I am missing only 5 trophys for the game but I just can&#39;t see myself getting the 2 that are bound to the not dieing even once, 1 for hard mode playthorught, 1 for not using any of your level up points (no double jump :( ) and then the speed run which it looks like i won&#39;t get in my current run but still hoping to half my time.",2017-09-14T22:30:54Z

alliebeemac,"I was chuckling when you went looking for Devries&#39; body because I knew you recycled it.  This game oddly does not protect everything you need from recycling charges.  I probably spent 20 minutes searching for an item I needed for a quesst only to realize later it fell prey to the dreaded powers of the recycler charge.  That&#39;s just rude, game!  Oh, and loading screens are snack and bathroom breaks.  Basically, its Arcane&#39;s version of the Allie break...minus the awesome music  :o)",2019-08-04T01:05:19Z

alliebeemac,"Also in general, I think the setting is such that slavery, the bearer system is just the way of life and accepted as natural. It’s like early Slave days before rebellions and such were thought of. So everyone’s attitude towards being “good slave owners” is seemingly a newer concept, which is why Clive’s dad, Elwin was such an anomaly and held in high regard by those sympathetic to the bearers plight.",2023-07-05T08:07:27Z
alliebeemac,"To be fair Allie, with Isabelle and Tatienne, Isabelle didn’t know that Yannick was practically stalking Tatienne, remember she didn’t tell her about him at all because she didn’t want her to be disappointed. So Isabelle only knows what Clive has told her. And also this is during a time when men pursuing women..aggressively was just seen as common and the norm.?",2023-07-05T08:04:06Z
alliebeemac,"This game puts a different twist on Nidhoggr.  In the game, she is guarding Yggdrasil&#39;s roots, but in the original Norse mythology, Nidhoggr is a HE and he&#39;s actually trying to KILL Yggdrasil by CHEWING on its roots (in some versions Nidhoggr is actually ENTANGLED in the roots of Yggdrasil and he&#39;s trying to free himself).  Also, fun fact about Nidhoggr, he is the main inspiration behind the Dragon Alduin in the game Elder Scrolls V:  Skyrim, because just like Alduin, Nidhoggr feeds on the souls of the dead.  He does so after Ragnarok has occurred, and he has a particular appetite for the souls of those who have committed murder, rape, and/or adultery.",2022-11-26T09:01:16Z
alliebeemac,"I really like the argument between the twins there.  Both have reasons for being upset (Freya was sold essentially to a toxic, abusive monster then imprisoned in Midgard with only a window to her home that she could never return to and Freyr was nearly burned alive by the Aesir after teaching them his magic, if you look at his arms you&#39;ll see the warped skin from the burns).  Both are hurt, and clearly mourning how they missed each other, but the pain allows them to get riled up fast.  Especially the more you learn about them, and how it was basically them fighting for their people until Odin and Mimir showed up.  Freya thought she was protecting her people, and Freyr was trying to help by teaching them to raise crops.  Neither knew exactly how bad the Aesir were and how they would quickly take and then break their promises.  After all, there was SUPPOSED to be peace, then Freya got to watch them set her brother on fire, and THEN be forced to marry Odin, who pulled a &#39;it was them, not ME&#39; on her to keep her from breaking off the marriage.  Well, until she finally got tired of the lies and saw him for what he REALLY was...",2022-11-26T17:00:34Z
alliebeemac,"btw there was now way to avoid Nidhögg’s death. Like Freya said, she would guard the roots used to bind Freya with her life, it was her or Freya.",2022-12-02T02:11:47Z
alliebeemac,Freya wasn’t “sold” to Odin. She and Odin both agreed to the marriage proposed by Mimir. She and Odin were at many times enjoying the marriage but then it turned sour. A lot of people in Vanaheim noticed and hated her for it. There is nuance but Freya wasn’t “forced”. Her people including her brother didn’t mind continuing the war but she made that decision on her own to stop it.,2022-11-28T11:43:42Z
alliebeemac,Ohgod the Secret Tunnel episode of Avatar is actually a perfect summary of this part of the game 🤣,2023-01-03T15:31:10Z
alliebeemac,"What’s important about Freya’s anger towards Kratos is that she is <b>completely</b> justified. In fact, what Kratos does to Freya is <b>exactly</b> what Athena did to Kratos at the beginning of the first God of War way back in 2005.",2022-12-13T20:25:45Z
alliebeemac,"I think it’s interesting that Kratos actually has a healthier relationship at this point with Freya than with his own son, because with Freya he doesn’t have those fears that make him want to stifle what she does, plus he feels deeply indebted to her for saving Atreus on top of her being an adult obviously.",2022-12-02T01:27:54Z

Lmao<br>I&#39;m actually shocked he&#39;s never punched Atreus tbh. Not that I want him to, just that, as a former Spartan and God-Killer, you&#39;d think Kratos would be much more abusive. But he&#39;s not. (Or at least, not nearly as bad as he could be.) So in a weird kinda way, good for him! lol",2022-11-26T15:51:23Z
alliebeemac,"Atreus is 14, not an adult, he must obey his father, he&#39;s behaving like an arrogant little sh*t who manipulates his own &quot;friends&quot; (Sindri above all) and who thinks he needs to be the hero of the story (demonstrating that he&#39;s not that much empathetic, he wants to &quot;help&quot; because he believes there&#39;s a grand script and that he&#39; the &quot;chosen one&quot;)!<br><br>If anything, Atreus is given way too much liberty from Kratos, especially considering his attitude and over-confidence in a situation that can get out of hand FOR EVERYONE involved!",2022-11-26T09:56:48Z

alliebeemac,most of the music in the game is original. But Anakin&#39;s Betrayal was used because the Order 66 moment is such a huge part of Star Wars history.,2020-01-14T04:36:05Z
alliebeemac,"If you like the original Star Trek, you should try Star Trek: 25th Anniversary and Judgment Rites if you haven&#39;t played them already.  They&#39;re available on GOG.

alliebeemac,I always wanted to play Harvest Moon but never did. I told my boyfriend for the past few weeks I wanted the game Harvest Moon Light of Hope for the  PS4. We went to GameStop and Walmart several times and neither one of them had it.

alliebeemac,RIP Part 7 😔,2022-06-24T21:53:33Z
alliebeemac,"I haaattteee the pull up game, Every single round is randomized, so it&#39;s impossible to even try to memorize, and the timing is whack. I just gave up on the expert difficulty version. Also, the Sewers quest is not a side-quest, it&#39;s main quest. You must do it to go forward, because you need the grappling hooks to go up, it just also ties into the Angel of the Slums sidequest if you&#39;re doing that one. I&#39;m glad that missing the optional Angel quest didn&#39;t block you off from the conclusion of that particular plot/mystery. <br><br><br>Little trivia bits about the OG- in the original version, Midgar slums have thick walls blocking off each sector, which prevents even the little amount of sunlight you see in this version (they&#39;re basically eternally in nightfall, and this is discussed in the first train scene in the OG, Cloud and Barret talk longer in that one, where it seems abruptly cut off in this one). This impacted the fall of Sector 7 in two significant ways: first, evacuation was completely impossible, because exits were bottle necked at doors, and the plate itself fell in one solid chunk, like a giant crusher slamming down into the ground. IMO, it made the scene where it fell way more terrifying to watch even though it was low-poly. Also, rather than using grappling hooks, they literally climbed up debris and the sheer wall to go up, which is where you learn that Barret is scared of heights. (the section with the sunlamps and all that leading into Reactor 5 is not in the original, so you don&#39;t get the opportunity to learn this before).<br><br><br>Also, my favorite affection scene was Aeris, because I just love the way Cloud reacts to Aeris. Although he&#39;s generally at ease and comfortable with Tifa, he&#39;s softest and most earnest with Aeris, and as cold and traumatized as he is, his connection with Aeris is adorable.",2020-04-27T11:59:54Z

alliebeemac,"I loved that emotional reaction, you clearly felt this game like all true fans did",2019-12-04T17:24:09Z
alliebeemac,"Sean is one of the most, if not the most, strongest characters in a video game I&#39;ve ever seen. He constantly was beaten down physically and emotionally, but always got back up and kept going. Even his notebook had the line &quot;we have to keep going&quot;. Every obstacle he faced he conquered. Even in the end, I don&#39;t count it as a surrender, but facing another feat and doing what he has to do for Daniel. <br><br><br>This story was so good from start to finish. I loved that they incorporated and highlighted very real and raw racial and immigration issues Latinos face within our society and the politics involved. It&#39;s amazing to see that game developers are able to not only combine the real world and fantasy, but do so accurately and organically. They didn&#39;t use stereotypes to create and develop their main characters, which is always amazing when the story is about people of color. <br><br><br>I definitely understand why Sean ran away with Daniel at the beginning of the game. It&#39;s very highly likely that nobody (or at least the justice system) would&#39;ve believed him even though he did nothing wrong. Although there&#39;s no evidence, a lot of times it&#39;s whoever can sway the jury willing he has a trial by jury. He&#39;s framed as a person of color who allegedly murdered a white cop. <br><br><br>I feel so bad for Sean. It&#39;s insane that he somehow ends up in jail for fifteen years even though he didn&#39;t hurt anyone. I&#39;m not sure if they charged him for the murder of the cop, but it was still upsetting. Not only that, but everyone else who tied him up, assaulted him, basically kidnapped his little brother, and was overall racist towards him received no punishment that we know of. I don&#39;t know if the developers did that on purpose to highlight that often times people get away with violent bigotry and racism, but that part really upset me. I liked the ending that you chose, and I suppose it&#39;s the Good/Best ending but is it really a good/best ending? <br><br><br>Some of the endings didn&#39;t make sense to me. I didn&#39;t understand how Sean was somehow able to survive and escape to Mexico when cops were shooting at him when he didn&#39;t have Daniel&#39;s shield while Daniel suddenly decided to jump out of the car, but somehow died when Daniel used his shield to protect the whole car while pushing and disarming all the cops. I definitely feel like there could&#39;ve been a way for them both to securely escape without Daniel having to abandon Sean and/or Sean dying (besides the last Low Morality choice). I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just the way of the developers showing the &quot;karma&quot; and impact of each choice though. <br><br><br>Overall, it&#39;s a very emotional, realistic, and raw video game and I can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s next.",2019-12-04T08:07:22Z
alliebeemac,Omg girl I was sobbing so bad like you. They don’t deserve this! I love them so much I am so attached to them! Especially Sean. My eyes are swollen and body hurts from all the crying. Just thinking about all they went thru makes my heart so heavy 🥺 I love these characters so much,2019-12-05T13:29:14Z
alliebeemac,"Loved this game. It&#39;s special. They managed to write a strong, but human, character in Sean. Also, the ending&#39;s tone depending on Daniel&#39;s morality, beside the big choice, reminded me of Arthur&#39;s endings in RDR2. Very strong.",2019-12-05T23:14:30Z
alliebeemac,I literally cried for almost an hour over this ending. And this is one of the good endings. The only ending that didn’t make me cry was the low morality cross the boarder ending.,2019-12-07T17:19:51Z
alliebeemac,"Endings from best to worst:<br><br>1: Sean escapes to Mexico and finds Cassidy and Finn. He’ll have a happy life with his best friend Finn... and who knows, maybe one day he might end up marrying Cassidy. While Daniel has a normal life with his grandparents, and hopefully will come to meet Max Caulfield someday...<br><br>2: Blood brothers. Sean and Daniel live in Mexico together. Maybe they might meet Cassidy and Finn again... maybe.<br><br>3: Sean goes to prison and loses half his life while Daniel has a normal one...<br><br>4: Lone wolf. Sean dies, no one except Daniel remembers him. And Daniel wastes his life as a criminal. He’ll never find love, not happiness. He’ll be a man with an incredible gift... a superpower. But he’ll have wasted it. Because he couldn’t cooperate with the way society works.",2020-04-19T01:18:35Z

alliebeemac,I had the same ending as you and cried my heart out...those poor babies deserved better...I loved your reactions and gameplay.,2019-12-06T21:16:56Z
alliebeemac,"According to Michael Koch, one of the creators of LIS with the prison ending and Sean&#39;s leaving this was what it meant. - Maybe it wasn&#39;t clear enough, but the idea is that Sean goes back on the road (hence the big backpack), but now as a free man. City Life is not for him anymore. He can rediscover the wilderness and life on the road, but by choice.<br><br><br>Somehow he becomes Brody.- <br><br><br><br>At least for me, that makes the ending a little better since he&#39;s finally free. Thought you&#39;d like to know.",2019-12-06T01:00:34Z
alliebeemac,"i completely agree with you. i got the blood brothers ending and i&#39;m really glad i did. its by far the best ending in my opinion. I do want to point out that in the lone wolf ending, there&#39;s a news article on the wall about a &quot;massacre at the border&quot;, but in the blood brothers ending, that article isnt there. if they had killed even a few of those cops, it would&#39;ve been called a massacre by the news. so the exclusion of that article tells me that in the blood brothers ending, they were probably just hurt or knocked out, not dead. my daniel and sean are not evil, they just didnt stand for the corrupt system. they just did what they had to do. I&#39;d also like to point out that daniel had no tatoos and overall looked pretty clean, so i dont think they are doing any business with the cartels. with daniel to keep the gangsters off their backs, i think sean is just able to make decent money doing honest work.<br><br>i think some people get confused because the devs&#39; use of the term &quot;morality&quot; but based on my own gameplay, I dont think this is intended to be a gauge between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, its more like &quot;family first&quot; vs &quot;society first&quot;, as the post game choices screen showed. i like to think of it kind of like the &quot;renegade vs paragon&quot; gauge in the mass effect games. daniel clearly isnt evil, not even in the lone wolf ending, as he easily could&#39;ve killed those gangsters that were making trouble for them, but he didnt. i think he&#39;s more lost in the lone wolf ending because he doesnt have his brother there to help guide him, so as a child all alone in a country who&#39;s language he wasnt fluent in, he sadly fell prey to gangsters and cartels who took advantage of him, and thats really sucks, but in the blood brothers ending, he has his brother to guide him and help him control his power.",2019-12-22T02:13:26Z
alliebeemac,"I got the blood brother ending, which I love and I’m so happy I got but I got very teary eyes when I watched you ending. Sean looked so broken and tired and it was so hard to see him like that.",2019-12-08T03:28:24Z
alliebeemac,"Omg this episode was a tear-jerker watched it as soon as I got home from work and I knew I was going to cry. I think you chose the best ending. You know I hate seeing you cry Allie, so of course just seeing that made me cry worse. Honestly I think I would have crossed the border because I wanted to be with Daniel. But I would have had high honer so I would have ended up shot. But I agree the best ending is with low honer. Loved your playthrough Allie.(now don&#39;t ever cry again LoL)💖",2019-12-04T21:31:19Z
alliebeemac,"Your playthroughs are so fun and entertaining to watch and I love your genuine heartfelt reactions 💚🙂 I felt they did something truly incredible and took a huge risk with this game. It’s become my favorite of all time, and I play it constantly and for once, I’m writing a fanfic, which I never do. But these topics of racism (even subtle points you don’t see often like the newspaper articles scattered throughout and some of Claire’s mannerisms and responses), the question of fitting in as mixed race kids, how immigrants are perceived in the US, it was super genuine and real, and I hope people continue to play it and that it opens a lot of hearts and minds. They’re important issues to me, and I write a lot about them in my own fiction as well. Emotionally, this affected me so much because they really make you care for these boys as if they’re you’re own family. Also as far as Daniel consistently learning as you teach him, and all the various little outcomes and dialogue you can uncover, I thought it was a brilliant gameplay mechanic that I’m not sure has ever been done before. This game is everything to me 💚",2020-08-18T04:09:24Z

JazzyGuns,Tips for the impostor: If the last 2 crewmates know damn well its you then sabotage. They cant call a meeting during sabotage.<br>More tips: Sabotaging lights is prob the best sabotage. ppl care less about lights. But they&#39;re quick to fix o2 and reactor. Also if u sabotage lights they cant see u. My strategy is sabotaging lights and killing then venting<br>More tips: If they choose to vote out ur partner u have to vote out ur partner. It makes u blend in. <br>More tips: ALWAYS KILL THE PERSON WATCHING CAMS<br>More tips: If u and ur impostor buddy r together and a crewmate sees u kill frame the crewmate. Its 2 vs 1<br>If u have a pet especially a mini crewmate u have to work faster. Becuase ppl can see ur pet vent with u. <br>More tips: The best map for impostor is polus. The Skeld has a good camera system and mira hq is too linear. Polus gives u a lot of space and the cameras are average. <br>More tips: I would recommend reporting at least 1 body every 2 times ur imposter. Impostors dont report bodies and if u know that nobody knows its a self report u can report.<br>More Tips: TAKE ADVANTAGES OF THE SABOTAGES BEFORE U FIX THEM! Like lights try to get a kill with lights. If you&#39;re grouped up probably not the best idea<br>More tips: If u trap someone kill them quickly. Because if someone sees a body they&#39;ll vote u out<br>More tips: If people r grouped up the best thing u can do is a stack kill or try to separate them<br>More tips: If someone sees u vent trap them or vent next to the button so u can catch them<br>If ur impostor play like u do as a crewmate. If u talk a lot as a crewmate u have to talk a lot as an impostor<br>Don&#39;t frame crewmates if confirm ejects are on. The best way to frame a crewmate is if everybody sees them doing something sus<br>when u fake tasks wait till the bar goes up.,2020-10-20T03:33:46Z

JazzyGuns,"Yeah, I knew instantly as soon as Phin appeared that she’s Tinkerer. It’s usually the significant characters that the protagonist knows but we’ve never seen before, then there’s her name Phin Mason, just like Tinkerer’s real name in the comics is PHINeas Mason. Even Insomniac Games knew this was the case, so they revealed Tinkerer’s identity almost as soon as she was introduced instead of near the end of the game, so kudos for that 😊",2020-11-15T00:20:47Z

LDShadowLady,i love these episodes! Are you gonna have more minecraft vs? I missed them,2015-09-24T23:48:18Z
LDShadowLady,"One thing that should be said: although you don&#39;t have the advantage of being a Youtuber with the disguised name, you DO have the advantage of choosing the theme, which gives you more time than any of the others to think about how you&#39;re going to build it, meaning that you&#39;ll almost always be able to make much better builds in the time allotted.",2015-09-26T04:45:57Z
LDShadowLady,I love watching you play build battle! Your builds are soo adorable! &lt;3,2015-09-24T23:42:39Z

LDShadowLady,"Omg. Lizzie, let me just say, you are my favorite youtuber of all time. Many other youtubers  have 30 minutes videos and are super boring. You however, are hilarious and keep it going the whole video! Keep doing what you are doing to make people happy! Every time I am finished watching one of your videos, I feel instantly happier. I love you Lizzie, keep it up!<br><br>Your #1 fan",2015-09-25T20:44:54Z

LDShadowLady,Lizzie: this must have token them ages <br><br>Me: yeah or 5 minutes,2018-08-23T17:25:37Z
LDShadowLady,"I&#39;m actually quite surprised how few people seemed to know what a Lucky Cat was. They&#39;ve been commonly associated with Japanese culture since I was little. Also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been to any family owned fancy Asian restaurant that doesn&#39;t have one somewhere.<br><br>I&#39;d think with that above tidbit and how anime is so popular now along with how frequently they appear in video games that just about everyone would know.<br><br>Had fun watching as always, Lizzie.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve never commented before and in case you actually do see this I wanted to thank you for helping me feel better with Shadowcraft after my fiancee left me last year. You and other YouTubers videos helped me get through the days when things got especially hard. You&#39;re an inspiration.<br><br><br>Oh, and a theme suggestion: Brave Little Toaster.",2015-09-26T13:36:36Z
LDShadowLady,I love it &lt;3! You build/create such great things,2015-09-25T06:01:08Z

LDShadowLady,"I love how Lizzie uses a disguise, she is so awesome.  And a great builder! And is fair. &lt;3 :D",2015-09-25T16:11:08Z

LDShadowLady,For the claws use the little blocks that you used for the eyes. That&#39;ll make it much more easier. 😃,2016-02-09T19:53:34Z
LDShadowLady,When I was visiting family in Japan I saw the little beckoning cats everywhere! I bought one and it&#39;s on my room x),2018-08-18T06:38:25Z

LDShadowLady,I love how she disguises as someone else because then she&#39;ll get honest opinions and not won just cause she&#39;s LDShadowlady,2015-09-26T18:17:09Z
LDShadowLady,Maybe I&#39;ll have to send Lizzie some mini furniture on Twitter! :3 I loved the Lucky Cat theme. It reminds me of Animal Crossing. :) ♡,2015-09-24T23:50:32Z
LDShadowLady,Your builds were lovely :) And it was nice of you to give everyone&#39;s builds above a poop <br>:) Oh and can you build a pony next time? It would be awesome if you did! :),2015-09-26T10:46:00Z

LDShadowLady,Hi Lizzie!! Could you set the theme next time as kitchen? I think that might be an interesting one💕,2015-09-25T00:55:22Z
LDShadowLady,I&#39;m pretty sure the &quot;cactus&quot; was supposed to be a four leaf clover,2020-11-19T22:28:40Z
LDShadowLady,"I bet you $500,000,000 dollars that Lizzie won&#39;t reply",2015-09-24T23:45:33Z

LDShadowLady,set the theme to Alice in Wonderland! Right now my community is doing it as a play (which I am in) and would love to see a build battle episode dedicated to it! I love you Lizzie and got a lot of people at my school interested in you!!!,2015-09-25T01:44:21Z
LDShadowLady,That was meee waving on the hill! :D,2015-12-20T21:27:09Z

LDShadowLady,"Lizzie earlier: WE&#39;RE GONNA DIE IN SOME STUPID WAY! Me now: Got dat right, Lizzie.",2016-09-28T00:13:05Z
LDShadowLady,Has anyone else noticed Lizzie always dies by fire?<br>Season 1: LDShadowlady walked into fire whilst fighting aureylian <br>Season 2: LDShadowlady was slain by ashleymariee (fire aspect)<br>And then this season,2016-10-15T03:48:20Z
LDShadowLady,10 out of 10 absolutely stunning,2016-12-07T09:21:06Z
LDShadowLady,&quot;Speed is Key&quot; don&#39;t sprint when close to lava lesson learned from Lizzie,2016-08-20T22:46:15Z
LDShadowLady,You found the ice spikes!,2015-12-20T21:13:49Z
LDShadowLady,Lizzie needs to do some sort of map that gives u only half a heart so she learns how to be more careful,2016-11-07T02:45:10Z
LDShadowLady,I love how at the end she just ends it right there,2015-12-28T08:26:43Z
LDShadowLady,"oh I&#39;m so sorry it was over so soon. I had really high hopes for you and wishing you so much luck! It must have felt awful. I would have let you join back on because it was just the first episode.. but then again it is hard core mode Minecraft... I love this series it reminds me of 1 life a friendly grace period, and then a massive purge. Good luck on your next UHShe season.<br>- biggest fan<br>P.S. I LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS!!",2018-07-06T15:54:38Z
LDShadowLady,so i feel like the intro somehow foreshadows the death due to lizzie dying in lava so here are my ideas.<br>Pip3rgames-She got shot at the ice biome<br>Aureylian- Died of fall damage<br>Mktheworst- suffocates in leaf block (you can suffocate in leaf blocks while riding a pig)<br>HeyImBee- was murdered while enchanting she was distracted<br>Kaleidow- somehow died due to snowballs (cause of death)<br>Shubble-Died from snowballs (cause of death)<br>Mousie-died in the center<br>Netty- died of TNT<br>Strawburry17- Was blown up to pieces by a creeper while looking at a mineshaft chest<br>lizzy-well.....<br>Yammy-could have ran out of food (was sprinting)<br>stacy-instead of taming she hit them<br>These are all theories and we know someone won.,2015-12-25T03:02:39Z
LDShadowLady,Can we just take a sec to appreciate this AMAZING intro like WOW,2022-01-21T22:17:43Z
LDShadowLady,What if the intro says how everyone dies XD,2015-12-20T22:40:10Z

LDShadowLady,I was actually so excited about this series. I think she should get a second chance as she only played for 16 minutes 😂😪,2015-12-21T10:17:21Z
LDShadowLady,lizzie you started off so well but you just had to not pay attention Rest In Pepperoni 🕊🕊,2016-10-22T00:59:36Z
LDShadowLady,I love how Lizzie just ran in to lava in the intro 😂 SO HAPPY FOR SEASON 3,2015-12-20T21:06:16Z

LDShadowLady,"Hey Lizzie! You&#39;ll never guess what!! I remember having a dream that I met you and now I REALLY want to. you really inspire me to just get on with life and not care and just have fun! you are always there for me and every video of yours I watch, whatever it is, they always make me smile!

LDShadowLady,"GG Lizzie! Speed is key! I will keep that advice!<br>I noticed a lot of people asking to bring Lizzie back. Why don&#39;t people realise the whole point of the game is when you die, that is it? It breaks all the rules bringing someone back into a game. It is the whole point to the game. Not only that this is all pre-recorded and finished. They just schedule uploads every 2 days. You wouldn&#39;t be able to bring her back.",2015-12-21T12:55:44Z
LDShadowLady,Lizzie <del>never</del> always dies by fire,2016-11-27T21:35:22Z

stacyplays,"You should name the redstone wolf after Jaspanda, as a tribute to him and everything he has done for you with redstone!",2016-06-24T21:16:48Z
stacyplays,"I&#39;d just like to say: I had a cat, his name was Niamaya. (Nee-UH-mai-UH) When I was little he was not very nice but I still loved him. He was a Ginger cat too. I wish Niamaya had made it to this day but, One day he got outside and my mom searched for him. She came home Empty-Handed and 3 days later he came back but he was peeing all over and we took him to our Grandparents farm. He was then an outdoor cat. He was sadly hit by a truck and it was very sad. But our neighbors had a HUGE litter of kittens and they called and asked if we wanted one. We said yes and she showed up with two kittens and said &quot;You get two&quot; and my mom said &quot;No I only want one!!!!&quot; But my mom eventually gave up, ad now we have two cats, Maggie and Emma. R.I.P.  Niamaya &lt;3",2016-07-14T02:08:52Z
stacyplays,"Could you name any cat (preferably ginger as my cat was ginger) Zumi after my cat that died due to cancer that affected his lungs and kidneys. It would be amazing to me as I know my cat lives on in this &quot;infinite series&quot; I know this comment will be lost in the sea of comments but i  only care if Stacy sees this. If you are reading this Stacy : I adopted this cat because i was inspired by you and your intro which says to rescue a dog, but i rescued a cat instead. I have had Zumi for 1 year after the vet told me he wouldn&#39;t make it due to his illness and then 5 days later he died.",2016-07-06T18:23:27Z

I even mod for someone who orders food on the phone DURING the stream and then goes to get it from the door. Nobody will care if your dog needs attention during a stream. You just need a lot of good mods to make sure people don&#39;t come into your chat acting like trolls. If you ever have any questions, feel free to ask me. :) and if not, then I would suggest talking to BaconDonut, TacticalPinup or even just email twitch headquarters. I would love to see you stream and you can bet that if you do, I&#39;ll be a steady name in chat.",2016-12-01T05:57:09Z

stacyplays,I have an idea for a build. I is a Pegasus taming building or tower that has slime on the bottom and a high ceiling so that when the Pegasus&#39; fly up and kick you off it won&#39;t kill you and you won&#39;t have to get then out of the water and a good name for the baby mermaid wolf is  Serena because it sounds like sirena and that&#39;s like the sirens of the sea. Like So Stacy will see,2017-06-15T06:13:54Z

You should name it this because Luna is the connection between the sea and the moon; and it&#39;s the baby of Pearl, (from the sea,) and Nimbus, (from the sky.)

If not than name it Triton like someone else said (can&#39;t remember their name, sorry) because they did their research too.",2017-06-14T22:56:26Z

Youtuber,Comments,Date
Dexbonus,I lived in Seattle for the last 4 years and only just moved to the east coast this year. That video makes me miss it SOOOOoooo MUCH!  Thank you for the nostalgic trip through Pike Place and the reminder that the gum wall is still just as gross/entrancing as I remember.,2012-08-30T22:39:05Z
Dexbonus,"5:34 is just the most adorable.

Thanks for the trip around Seattle, Dodger.  I like these on-the-move vlogs.",2012-08-31T07:22:00Z
Dexbonus,"After working late last night, i woke up in a REAL foul mood. And again, your videos always manage to put a smile on my face. Thank you x",2012-08-31T09:30:34Z
Dexbonus,The Ducks! They are so fun. The drivers are so funny! I hope you get to do that adventure sometime. :),2012-08-30T22:44:20Z
Dexbonus,You seem like such a friggin fun person to hangout with! I laughed like crazy... I stumbled on this while looking for vids of Seattle. I&#39;m thinking of moving there next spring. Looks like you guys are fun chill people :),2012-10-24T06:54:20Z
Dexbonus,"Wow, that was a fun tour.
Also, it&#39;s interesting to see the world from a Dodger POV.",2012-09-25T01:41:01Z
Dexbonus,Dodger you really need to do more of the on the street vlogs. You&#39;re really good at it. Don&#39;t stop with the coffeh time but maybe once in a while do a walk around blog when you go on set for something. Or go spend the day with Ro. ,2012-08-30T23:46:04Z
Dexbonus,"Dude, dodger makes everything so much funner to watch. She could film grass growing and her commentary makes it exciting.
",2012-08-31T18:46:44Z
Dexbonus,"I was just in Seattle two days ago, looking at the same Space Needle Dodger was. I feel honored to have been in the same city as someone as legendary as Dodger.",2012-08-31T03:11:52Z
Dexbonus,"I LOVE these kind of videos, please keep them coming! :3 :3
Also, I just experienced what &quot;differently tall&quot; people see from a lower point of view xD",2012-08-30T21:58:24Z
Dexbonus,Oh gosh Dodger I was smiling the whole time you need to do more vlogs like this! &lt;3 xx,2012-08-31T04:28:48Z
Dexbonus,yaaaa we need more vlogs of your adventures!!!! You are always so funny!,2012-08-30T22:41:37Z
Dexbonus,This was a fun video...have a great time Dodger!,2012-08-30T22:06:03Z
Dexbonus,"Soo much win! can I just say that I am so stoked that at the end of the video I saw that Dodger was wearing the Jacket I sent.. Dodger, you just made my day! &lt;3",2012-08-31T03:27:10Z
Dexbonus,"I loled when you were talking about the ferris wheel breaking and then next scene: &quot;Sara won&#39;t go on the ferris wheel with me :(&quot;
Also being taken for a 13 year old is hilarious.",2012-08-30T23:19:38Z
Dexbonus,"I like it when vloggers travel while record it keep its interesting.One time I really wanted to move to Seattle,but that is when bands like Nirvana came out.",2012-08-30T22:48:15Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger doing her Hot Girl Weird Laugh (Family Guy) again. Also as good as the daily, sitting in her room vlogs are, we NEEEEEED more of these walking around vlogs. So good!!!",2012-08-30T23:29:23Z
Dexbonus,"Running into you a few times at Pike Place was kind of nuts.Would have said hey,but looked like you and Sara were doing your own thing at the time. Awesome meeting you on Friday though.",2012-09-04T04:38:04Z
Dexbonus,I love how the camera&#39;s at everyone&#39;s shoulder/stomach level when she walks through crowds.,2012-08-31T00:55:18Z
Dexbonus,Those duck boat tour type things are available all over the world. If you come to New Zealand you can go on the Rotorua Duck Tours. They are certainty an amazing WWII military landing craft to still be going strong after over 60 years since they first where produced. I know London and Singapore have them and I think I saw an advert for a duck tour in Canada.,2012-08-31T01:39:01Z
Dexbonus,"Oooh so much things you can do in Seattle!!! The other side of the Seattle Wheel is the Alki Beach, if you go there at night there are bunch of people wearing neon colours long boarding and skating and biking... The Paramount theatre is gorgeous- as is the Benaroya Hall in which Seattle Symphony frequently plays in. Art and street performances are Seattle&#39;s proud culture... I wish you lived in Seattle Dodgerrrrrrr",2012-08-30T23:19:19Z
Dexbonus,There needs to be more walking around vlogs!!!,2012-08-31T01:08:46Z
Dexbonus,omg you should do more of these!!! i sooo enjoyed this,2012-08-31T03:03:28Z

Dexbonus,"While eating breakfast &quot;So this is the gum wall....&quot; Thanks Doger, that was very appetizing lol. xD",2012-08-30T22:09:15Z

Dexbonus,Please make a part 2 and that it includes more of that Awesome Golden Optimus Prime! Great video Dodger!,2012-08-31T03:34:50Z
Dexbonus,"Wow, watching this is like a 12 year old&#39;s POV.... Dodger, you have now reached the top of my &quot;Awesome of the Amazing-ness-ness&quot; list.",2012-08-30T23:48:36Z
Dexbonus,"Omg, I asked her to get out more with the camera and a few days later she&#39;s out and about!  that&#39;s so awesome!  Thankyou!",2012-08-31T19:15:09Z
Dexbonus,So this is what it feels like to be short. The world is so different from Dodger&#39;s perspective.,2012-08-31T00:14:42Z
Dexbonus,"Cool! Seattle&#39;s a great place. Flew up there every month (or drove whenever gas was cheaper) to see my daughter during my custody hearings. Yes I did win =D But we had great times up there, so now she hates cali (mostly the heat....lol)",2012-08-31T00:01:39Z
Dexbonus,now i know what it feels like to be Dodger-sized and walk through crowds or people,2012-09-12T16:25:14Z
Dexbonus,"More vlog&#39;s like that... :-) see the world with Dodger
",2012-08-31T06:26:51Z
Dexbonus,does oregon have mild summers like seattle? 70s with clear skies or some clouds is what i love about the northwest. after watching this and Ro&#39;s walk through I still don&#39;t know where that gum wall is. hopefully she has more videos of her seattle visit.,2013-01-08T10:03:51Z
Dexbonus,Dodger is so small! I WANT A DODGER! ^_^ So cute.,2012-09-06T21:10:11Z
Dexbonus,"I can probably guarantee that this has already been said, but Dodger is super cute. ",2012-08-30T22:50:53Z
Dexbonus,"I need to take that Ferris Wheel. The only time I ever go to Seattle is special occasions like family from out of town.

You didn&#39;t run into that juggling dude? Err, there&#39;s probably a bunch. There was this one right outside the shops I once sat in the car waiting for the group to catch up and that was my entertainment.

I recommend checking out the library. I love that place. It&#39;s free to get in, the building itself is all sorts of interesting, and each floor has a theme. It&#39;s been a while tho.",2012-08-30T22:52:57Z
Dexbonus,Hahaha When she was walking around in the StarBucks she seemed so short hahaha She&#39;s Amazing,2012-08-31T10:47:25Z
Dexbonus,You should do more of these kind of videos,2012-08-30T22:50:55Z
Dexbonus,"I think I just fell in love...  Oh, and Seattle seems nice too.  Thanks for the tour!",2012-11-07T20:53:11Z
Dexbonus,"Its really weird seeing my city in a video. But at the same time, it&#39;s great seeing some of my favorite people enjoying me city.",2012-08-31T02:42:42Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger is so adorable, I think I&#39;m going to explode.",2012-09-07T09:07:59Z
Dexbonus,That was awesome XD and the pike place is awesome fun place. I liked the fishing tossing time lol.,2012-09-04T06:54:21Z
Dexbonus,It&#39;s amusing you can tell how tall other people are because of where Dodger holds the camera.,2012-08-30T21:58:53Z
Dexbonus,The gum wall seems kind of cool. And kind of what I&#39;d expect to see if I went to California. Do gold Optimus Primes come with every caraselle ride or with every starbucks purchase?,2012-08-30T22:28:25Z
Dexbonus,"don&#39;t deny it, you know you were lovin&#39; that carousel ride more than you would have the ferris wheel. :)",2012-08-31T01:19:40Z
Dexbonus,Can you do more vlogs like this? :3,2012-08-30T23:42:10Z
Dexbonus,Adorable Dodger is adorable.,2012-09-01T17:08:14Z
Dexbonus,i know how dodger feels. im 25 and made a new friend about a month ago. he asked me if i start high school in the fall or if im in elementary school still lol that made my friends night to say the least. they sure got lulz out of that,2012-08-31T03:03:44Z
Dexbonus,So funny and cute! ;-),2012-08-31T05:32:20Z
Dexbonus,"Well, Dodger. I&#39;m so glad to see that you have started going into metalworking. I am a machinist. I make airplane parts for my job. I also machine parts as a hobby in my garage.  It&#39;s a great activity. It is not that expensive because, you can do projects for other people, since most people don&#39;t buy a small milling machine and a lathe. I put a few thousand dollars in my hobby and I don&#39;t regret it at all. It just takes a lot of space and cutting tools can been expensive sometimes. ",2013-01-15T00:56:15Z
Dexbonus,"Was having an unbelievably shitty day, but then I watched the collective awesomeness that is Dodger, Jesse Cox, and TB (the TGS podcast highlights, DIY+Coffeh, Q&amp;A) and I felt a lot better. For this I am ever grateful. ",2013-01-14T07:38:35Z
Dexbonus,I have a real fear that one day I will meet Ro and Dodger at the same time and die from cuteness overload.,2013-01-14T23:32:47Z
Dexbonus,"The stamps can be used on leather aswell. My friend uses them a lot and he makes them himself. You need some big nails, saw, few files and some patience. The posibilities are infinite! Thumbs up so Dodger can see :)",2013-01-14T15:27:42Z
Dexbonus,One of the multiple reasons I love dodger is that she is a rare breed on the internet. A woman whose video&#39;s screens are half covered with their boobs. Thank you Dodger! ,2013-01-14T08:09:42Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger, just want to thank you for your videos. I look forward to watching them everyday. Keep up the good and hard work. I really appreciate it.",2013-01-14T07:37:27Z
Dexbonus,"Listening to you makes me happy, we are half the world apart but i feel i know i would enjoy hanging with you and you with me.  i will definitely vote if that will help you in any way! Best regards",2013-01-14T16:59:56Z
Dexbonus,I need friends like hers. They sound like they have the best of times together.,2013-01-15T03:17:34Z
Dexbonus,Only problem with the cheaper stamps is you want to stick to the softer metals as the harder metals will blunt the cheap stamps fast. Most of the cheaper stamps are normally for stamping into soft metals or leather only. I have actually used them to also stamp into paper and card!,2013-01-14T08:00:45Z
Dexbonus,"Thank you for the kisses, I feel much better now. I&#39;m glad you are feeling better too! Flea market eh? Huh, yeah one can get a lot of things one does not need in those places. Sometimes it&#39;s pretty great.",2013-01-14T23:49:17Z
Dexbonus,Glad to hear you are feeling better~! Good luck with keeping that up! Good luck with your continue uploading! :),2013-01-15T15:18:29Z

Dexbonus,"If Ro and Dodger win the shorty awards, that would be both ironic and awesome. The internet needs to make this happen ;D",2013-01-15T04:54:18Z
Dexbonus,Dodger I watch all of your videos and they really help me threw the day..I just wanted to thank you &lt;3,2013-01-15T04:38:37Z
Dexbonus,"Flea markets were one of my favourite little days out when I visited the states, seemed so much more interesting than our car boots haha",2013-01-14T22:49:02Z
Dexbonus,"It&#39;s my birthday soon, I&#39;ll be 25 and people have been suggesting that I &#39;grow up&#39; and all that nonsense.  Luckily, we&#39;ve got Dodger to remind us all that if the moment takes us, we can run around like a little kid, and that&#39;s ok :)",2013-01-14T23:37:28Z
Dexbonus,Metal stamps are so cool! :D I had to use them last year in shop class and I thought they were epic,2013-01-14T21:46:52Z
Dexbonus,I miss CA flea markets. I moved to Pennsylvania and there aren&#39;t as good a flea markets unless I want to drive 6 hours to Philly. No one takes cards and its really rare to find anything good. Lots of candle and inflatable pencil ladies. Lots. Those are some awesome finds though :),2013-01-14T08:19:15Z
Dexbonus,"the DIY was amazing! I&#39;m excited to transform some game maps! Also, your brain is awesome.",2013-01-14T14:50:44Z
Dexbonus,I hope you feel better Dodger :),2013-01-14T07:31:25Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger... we need an &quot;directors cut&quot; version of that DIY video.. there is so many lols in there, I feel it! Thinking the behind the scenes of ro&#39;s nerdy nummies with THE Jesse Cox as the baseline :P",2013-01-14T16:04:07Z
Dexbonus,Dodge! Is there a TY video coming anytime soon? For all the Christmas/holiday prezzies you must have gotten? :p btw the DIY was herlerious :D you and Jesse compliment each other so well :),2013-01-14T07:26:27Z
Dexbonus,"This is true, a rubber mallet is usually a safer alternative to a metal hammer if it is not too large for the task at hand.
That said, the rear end of those stamps are most likely &#39;Tempered&#39;, meaning in layman&#39;s terms, that they will &#39;mushroom&#39; (The edges will begin to fold over, a good example could be an old center punch, or cold chisel), rather than cracking, or shattering.
THAT said, those stamps are designed for use on non-ferrous metals, heated ferrous metals (at LEAST &#39;red&#39; hot), and wood",2013-01-14T11:36:56Z
Dexbonus,Glad you&#39;re feeling better Dodge.,2013-01-14T08:56:32Z
Dexbonus,making a $(%*ing twitter account so I can vote for you and Ro.  You both are worth it.,2013-01-17T07:20:57Z

Dexbonus,"Dodger, I love watching Coffee time, I really do, but I&#39;m voting for bingradio&#39;s Past Bing / Future Bing.  As a Blog project it is amazing and it wins my vote.

Next year I&#39;ll vote for you :)",2013-01-14T10:50:49Z
Dexbonus,"you can vote once for each category. Since Cox n&#39; Crendor is in the podcast category, and Dodger is in the vloger category, you can vote for both :D",2013-01-14T08:35:32Z
Dexbonus,Love how Dodger has a hammer within arms reach!,2013-01-14T14:24:36Z
Dexbonus,Dodger: I believe the item you were trying to name that is used to display things in a kitchen is a Welsh Dresser or China Hutch.,2013-01-14T10:23:24Z
Dexbonus,"Gotta always be prepared for that time.

When you just gotta... you know.

Stop.

Hammertime!",2013-01-15T03:50:23Z

Dexbonus,"I once bought a bed-stand at a flea market. I couldn&#39;t open the drawer until I got home, and it turns out it was glued shut with a pigeon inside it.",2013-01-15T04:10:09Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger, I&#39;m Mexican and although you&#39;ve been talking about Orchata for quite a long time now, I never understood what you were talking about until now due to the way you pronounced it. When you said it was Mexican and started to describe it, I was like OOHHH Orchata!!  xP",2013-01-14T14:23:02Z
Dexbonus,"Unless she heats up the metal she is stamping, but otherwise totally agree, not only be careful Dodger, wear some safety glasses.",2013-01-14T08:45:30Z
Dexbonus,"Say Dodger, you should look up a local metalsmithing guild, its a great practice, and i think you would enjoy it. Oh and before you use those stamps look up thoroughly how to properly use them and wear safety gear, like safety glasses. Old metal often has very small flaws that under the right stress can break and ruin the stamps and hurt you. ",2013-01-14T08:54:19Z
Dexbonus,understandable :D normally you can buy canvas paper and print places onto it and then use that instead so that your map can stay intact! &lt;3,2013-01-14T07:29:19Z
Dexbonus,"Actually, Horchata is original from Valencia, Spain (where I live :D). And is not made from rice, it&#39;s made from tigernuts. It was exported to South America and they made it from rice, and that&#39;s what you get in the US.",2013-01-17T16:46:54Z

Dexbonus,"You&#39;re at your desk (or whatever), you hear a strange sound. &quot;who&#39;s there?&quot;, you ask.

You scan for something to aid you against the enemy, you reach over for your trusted hammer, perfect for fighting against the evil nail-mites (or for anything really) nail-mites lose the end outofcharcters",2013-01-15T04:29:18Z

It&#39;s the best Because honey has antibacterial properties and it will will coat your throat.Due to it&#39;s antibacterial properties Honey is one of the few foods that doesn&#39;t spoil. There is honey that has been found in Egyptian tombs that is still edible today.,2014-04-04T06:08:40Z

Dexbonus,"Dodger, I know I am late to the game but as far as you being sad I think you are doing the best thing. You are sharing your pain with us.

Dexbonus,"Be careful of where you&#39;re coughing from, Dodger.  If it&#39;s in your chest, you really want to go to the doc, because there&#39;s a good chance of that being bronchitis or pneumonia.

Dexbonus,"what can help is if you grieve for what ever happened. work through the emotions instead of hiding from them. Allow your self to cry, morn, and grieve for what ever happened and if there are good memories that have to deal with it then remember them and laugh. Because after all that you can move forward and cope with what ever happened",2014-04-04T22:00:22Z
Dexbonus,A good way to get over being sad is to take to someone about the problem and try you best to not think about it or do things that cheer you up more when you get sad,2014-04-04T03:14:51Z

Dexbonus,"Dodger! If you&#39;re planning on singing, don&#39;t have any cough drops, they&#39;ll just dry you out and make it harder on your throat. Drink plenty of water and hot lemon and honey. And if all else fails, don&#39;t talk for as long as humanly possible. It sucks but it&#39;s the best thing you can do for your voice. Take care of yourself girl!",2014-04-04T13:26:59Z
Dexbonus,"sometimes you just have to cry it out buddy, get well soon HUGS =)",2014-04-03T23:23:17Z
Dexbonus,This sounds alarmist and bit silly..but ever since Dodger said her neck was bothering her (plus the headaches she was having week plus ago) I have been worried about meningitis. I&#39;m sure its just a bug..or a cold..but I really hope if she isn&#39;t feeling better soon she does get checked out. Feel better soon !,2014-04-06T04:52:36Z

Dexbonus,"If this &#39;family stuff&#39; has really been bothering you, you should think about sharing it with someone, not the internet for obvious reasons, but a close friend, or maybe even a therapist might do you some good. A problem shared is a problem halved is clichéd but that&#39;s because its true. Hope you get over it soon (Both the cough and the sadness).",2014-04-04T17:39:48Z

Dexbonus,"I&#39;m coughing a lot myself these days but generally what works for me is eating either chili (basically stuff with chilipeppers in), garlic or if you can stomach it, ginger. Ginger clears your system reeeally well, but can be tough to eat. That or just soothe your throat with ice cream =D",2014-04-05T15:26:16Z
Dexbonus,"If you can handle spicy things, I would say go for chili. Not the food(like chili con carne) but the spicy pepper. I used to have larynx/bronchial infections about 2-3 times a year and they were BAD. My voice sounded like gravel being grated on a chalkboard, throat felt the way I sounded pretty much.<br><br>After I started using fresh hot chilies(everything from Piri piri to Cayenne to the megahot varieties like Trinidad Scorpion and Naga Ghost chili) weekly in my homecooking, eating more fresh fruit and adding fresh ginger to my food &amp; tea I haven&#39;t had a single prolonged infection anywhere. Some 1-3 day sniffles very rarely but nothing major since December 2011. Then again I don&#39;t go to conventions and meet new people nearly at the rate you do. <br><br>But if not prevent, these things introduced to regular consumption will shorten and alleviate your colds.",2014-04-04T09:16:48Z
Dexbonus,"Look Dodger, I&#39;ve been through hard times myself, family stuff going bad and shit. <br>And that family stuff made other things worse, besides that my country was going through more shit, so stress was all around me. <br>The thing that I found is that, you just have to not get sucked into anything emotionally, this may be hard to understand and it may sound weird, but now I just accept things that happen, I understand that they happen but I don&#39;t get affect emotionally, like nothing would break me, or ruin my day or week unless it&#39;s something huge like a death of my loved ones.  <br><br>But nothing else, you hear the news and be like, well shit happens, can we solve that problem? if yes then we think logically about it and try to solve it, if no then you know that life goes on and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this is better, it&#39;s starting to make me feel emotionless, but to me it&#39;s better than getting sadder and sadder by the day.",2014-04-03T23:56:12Z
Dexbonus,"feel better, dooger! and what are you talking about? everyone eats cough drops that way. SLURPSLURPSLURP. also that intro was super adorable, by the by.",2014-04-04T04:58:10Z

Dexbonus,"You&#39;re an amazingly understanding and insightful person. It so refreshing to see someone who&#39;s actually truly happy. I just had the most miserable day of my life. Like, I&#39;m not even joking. My life is a mess. I come home, watch this video...and I feel so much better. This isn&#39;t mindless internet adoration, I&#39;m being genuine.

Thanks Dodger.",2011-04-13T19:20:18Z
Dexbonus,"I agree with you about making short term goals, anything to keep you doing what you want to do as opposed to feeling defeated and shifting your goals to &quot;surviving&quot;, this makes a person powerless over their own life. Also the process of achieving said goals is just as, if not more satisfying then actually achieving them.",2011-09-09T16:04:01Z

Dexbonus,"There&#39;s a difference between being forboding and resolute. I&#39;m sure I would have seemed very cynical at your age, too. But certain decisions left me with the habits of letting go of the little things, not leaving important things unfinished, and still have fun. Those habits are good ones to cultivate.

I like the night time lighting. It makes you look like a Vlogging Ghostess.",2011-04-13T09:29:15Z

Dexbonus,So much computing power. This will really revolutionise the way she plays 2D pixel art games and dating sims.,2016-01-09T14:34:53Z
Dexbonus,"I don&#39;t know if we got the experience Intel intended but we certainly got the totally expected Dooger experience...which, let&#39;s face it, is a million times more entertaining.",2015-09-07T19:00:00Z
Dexbonus,"Don&#39;t even worry about it, Dodger; I watch a bunch of tech channels and the Intel Box was messed up in shipping for most of them.  Most people had to get replacements sent; you got the original to work, so props to you.",2015-09-07T18:48:36Z
Dexbonus,The meltdown about turning it on was just the best. I hope intel keeps doing this every year just so we keep getting these unboxings.,2015-09-07T18:39:12Z
Dexbonus,I&#39;m pretty sure that Intel is now intentionally trolling her :P,2015-09-07T19:24:51Z
Dexbonus,the previous unboxing was the greatest thing ever,2015-09-07T18:28:21Z
Dexbonus,At this point I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they sabotaged it on purpose to get another train wreck.,2015-09-07T18:46:42Z

Dexbonus,You&#39;re editing is so wonderful. It really amplifies what you&#39;re saying and makes things funny when they aren&#39;t (not saying you&#39;re not funny),2015-09-07T18:44:33Z
Dexbonus,"Yet again, this is the best Intel unboxing of the year.",2015-09-07T19:09:37Z
Dexbonus,"I was so impressed by your ability to get the one with the loose battery.  They specifically made it battery powered you that you couldn&#39;t screw it up, and fate was like &quot;Ha ha ha, yeah, no, you&#39;re screwin&#39; this up Dodgester.&quot;",2015-09-09T02:41:56Z

Dexbonus,"Dodger, I can see the people at Intel all gathering in the office with popcorn just to watch your unboxing. I was laughing so hard I was crying!",2015-09-10T03:07:37Z

Dexbonus,All of your costumes looked fantastic dodger! hope you had some fun this Halloween!,2013-11-01T08:58:03Z
Dexbonus,"Luigi&#39;s Ghost Mansion was the best part. Your freakouts were hilarious, especially when your fellow Friend Zoners were reeling from the how loud you were. Loved it, absolutely loved it. xD",2013-11-02T00:26:18Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger your screaming was the best part of that FriendZone episode

Dexbonus,"I have to admit, when I watched Friendzone and you were screaming, I was non stop laughing my ass off (nearly literally).  I have no idea why, but it was crazy.",2013-11-01T09:32:58Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger, I personally didn&#39;t mind the screaming. It was hilarious to watch you freak out and get so invested in the game.",2013-11-01T14:19:06Z
Dexbonus,Your cats are cute. I end watching them playing catching in the background. :),2013-11-03T13:33:40Z
Dexbonus,The bright orange eyeshadow is a good look for you Dooger :),2013-11-02T17:30:09Z
Dexbonus,"Just a tip, if you are trying to make weapons and armor and stuffs capturing is superior to killing as you get more / better items from the monster. and you should definitely upload you playing it solo",2013-11-01T20:14:17Z
Dexbonus,"Stay away from makeup Dodger, you&#39;re beautiful the way you are &lt;3",2013-11-01T12:46:06Z

Dexbonus,"Yes! I would absolutely watch every Monster Hunter video you put up, because you and the game are so entertaining :D",2013-11-01T22:50:11Z
Dexbonus,I was screaming throughout friendzone too. Every time the ghost got you I screamed just like you,2013-11-01T17:58:44Z
Dexbonus,I love when two youtuber I&#39;ve followed for ages (like Dodger and cinnamontoastken) actually meet in real life :),2013-11-02T17:37:36Z
Dexbonus,"Dodger, is there any chance for Jesse to be a permanent guest on the Friendzone? He was amazing on the newest one and he mashes so well with everyone, including you.",2013-11-02T03:25:21Z
Dexbonus,"capturing monsters in monster hunter is actually really easy once you know what to do. just fight the monster like you normally do, but when it starts limping let it flee to its sleeping place and once its sleeping sneak up to it, place the trap next to it, let it activate and throw your tranq bombs",2013-11-01T17:54:19Z
Dexbonus,"Caught Friendzone live for once. Was absolutely hilarious! Unfortunately they never showed any of my tweets :(

Also that boardgame you played was virtually impossible to follow as a spectator lol.",2013-11-02T00:31:40Z
Dexbonus,She cleans her ear wax. Dumps it on desk. Then rubs itchy nose and I&#39;m all like distracted my background cats,2013-11-03T17:55:59Z
Dexbonus,"&#39;I scream a LOT&#39; that is an understatement, Dodger. ",2013-11-01T11:27:03Z
Dexbonus,"I really enjoy your game walkthroughs too Dodger! 

They are very entertaining but never get in the way of the game!

Like your stanley parable one. I would LOVE to see you do a walkthrough of something like Mass Effect, Walking dead, etc. 
Love the way this channel has grown!

",2013-11-02T06:42:34Z
Dexbonus,"HELL YES I wanna see more Monster Hunter!

Don&#39;t sweat it, Dodge, you pulled off Elvira just fine.  You were totally sportin&#39; some cleavage which, as you mentioned, is a fundamental part of the character/costume.",2013-11-01T13:15:32Z
Dexbonus,"Yeah I thought the last person you were trying to remember on COFFEH yesterday was Chad, but I was surprised it wasn&#39;t him.

Anyway, Friend Zone was great this week! The best parts were the accidental swearing, especially when you were playing Typing Of The Dead. LOL",2013-11-01T14:23:05Z
Dexbonus,The screaming on Friendzone was great :) ,2013-11-01T07:52:31Z

Dexbonus,"First time I&#39;ve ever caught a Coffeh Time video before the thumbnail was showing up on it.  I feel special!

Looking forward to friend zone, though I can&#39;t watch it tonight.  Maybe if I didn&#39;t need to sleep...",2013-11-01T08:00:41Z
Dexbonus,"I didn&#39;t found the screaming annoying at all, I laughted so much at those moments xD",2013-11-01T16:09:05Z
Dexbonus,You said you think you need to capture Lagiacrus. IIRC you don&#39;t. To continue the village quests you need to go under the waterfall in the farm area of the village to get the ancient mask and/ or complete the village request that the elder&#39;s son will have for you to make that mask. Which will unlock the next story quest.,2013-11-01T10:35:02Z
Dexbonus,"friendzone was awesome :D
reason most people wanted you to stop was because you kept breaking it to the point that it would just Screech instead...but your panicing makes it more fun :D

also dodger you decided on what you going to hang over that door then? it&#39;s still empty....blank...not there....can&#39;t think of a word that works. but yeah you know what i mean :D",2013-11-01T16:32:03Z

Dexbonus,"I loved the screaming xD that just like made it for me, like it was hilarious and just yeah. Don&#39;t listen to chat it&#39;s way more entertaining if you just be you :P they can turn down their volume x3",2013-11-01T08:07:49Z
Dexbonus,"Surprised you got any voice left after Friend Zone :D

Loved your Elvira, no need for the stuffing but it would possible make it even more far out :P",2013-11-01T14:42:20Z
Dexbonus,Dooger if the Youtube thang ever goes south you always have a promising future as a banshee ,2013-11-01T08:48:44Z

Dexbonus,I also injoy a nice goofy face to brighten my day,2013-11-02T04:38:33Z
Dexbonus,The battle that is raging in the background with those cats will go down in history.,2013-11-02T04:59:47Z
Dexbonus,"You look beautiful and that orange eyeshadow really suits you and I never get tired of seen you in that spiderman shirt, you da best :)",2013-11-01T18:00:02Z
Dexbonus,"I would totally love to see you record more Monster Hunter and your pro skill, Dodger. Maybe you could even do a video where you can actually TEACH Jesse how to play the game and do like 4 player co-op with like Jesse, TB and say PBG or ProJared.",2013-11-01T08:48:32Z
Dexbonus,"The little bit I saw of friendzone was a blast, will be watching from start to finish most definately :)",2013-11-01T10:34:03Z

Dexbonus,"I hope dodger reads this:
Dodger describe Jesse with one word. :D",2013-11-01T07:46:54Z
Dexbonus,&quot;...unless you want to watch me kill ridiculous monsters.&quot; well yeah Dodger we all want to see you kill monsters. Or really play anything for that matter,2013-11-01T08:46:44Z

Dexbonus,"Happy Thanksgiving, Derger and family!",2012-11-22T02:50:31Z
Dexbonus,"Plus also through each hardship there is a lesson to learn. Some of which aren&#39;t always obvious, but if you learn them you are almost insured to never make the exact same mistake again. This I know from my experience with this life we live. ",2012-11-25T02:45:30Z
Dexbonus,I feel like meatloaf is one of those things that are hit or miss. Like your mothers meatloaf is always the best but your always afraid to try someone else&#39;s meatloaf.,2012-11-22T07:15:46Z
Dexbonus,For some reason when you grabbed the apple juice I yelled &quot;WAIT DODGER NO WHAT IF IT&#39;S URINE&quot; This is how my mind operates.,2012-11-22T06:03:45Z
Dexbonus,"My friend and I had a long discussion about Meat Loaf on the tube once. It was decided by a bunch of random people that we should have our own TV Show....

Dexbonus,the talking about the things and such so cute starting to feel like a weirdo watching the videos just cheers up,2012-11-22T18:44:50Z
Dexbonus,"I like most meatloaf except for this one the local supermarket sells that has a apricot sauce glaze. I prefer the plain one they sell. I also love a scotch egg that is like a big round crumb coated meatloaf with a boiled egg in the center.

Dexbonus,My dad&#39;s meatloaf is the best. he also puts onions (which with anything else i hate) and slices of bacon over the top. It is so moist and delicious.,2012-11-22T06:17:44Z
Dexbonus,"I&#39;m also in Nova Scotia, Canada, and the large factory farms of other regions are mostly unknown here.  Most of the meat we get locally is more &quot;old school&quot; - free range, on a farm, not on massive feed lots.  Ditto our agriculture - actual crop rotation OH MAH GERRDS

Dexbonus,"I wanted it to be some type of liquor and then see her make a disgusting/shocked face, but Dodger doesn&#39;t make disgusted faces drinking any alcoholic beverages if TGS Podcast #14&#39;s terrible tasting wine is anything to go off of!",2012-11-22T03:28:12Z
Dexbonus,"Today, a young woman in Oregon was found trapped inside her own hoodie, barely responding to stimuli and severely dehydrated. The local fire department were the first on scene, and they immediately radioed for army grade hydraulic rescue tools, otherwise known as &quot;jaws of life&quot;.
The police questioned the woman, but she refused to give any details on the matter.",2012-11-22T13:42:48Z
Dexbonus,"I love the meatloaf my mom made when I was a kid, She used ketchup and ground beef, oat meal and eggs.
But I have discovered there are different ways people make meatloaf!! they add  sausage to the beef, beef and veal, breadcrumbs, corn breadcrumbs,cornflakes, saltine crackers, egg white or no egg! And some people I hear eat it with Brown Gravy with mushrooms on top Not Ketchup!?!? Seasoning varies upon where you are (restaurant or home, North,South, East or West)I like onion and Green pepper.

Dexbonus,LMAO I never noticed that. Thank you for pointing it out. It will make any video 100% more hilarious.,2012-11-22T16:01:45Z
Dexbonus,"if it&#39;s what I think it is - it&#39;s like a less cohesive omlette :) - and much better imo (I usually go either jalapenos, cheese, onions, and corn.... or meat, shredded potatoes, and a bit of sour cream :P)",2012-11-22T03:06:54Z

As her father was a psychopath undercover. Her father LOVED dolls, he would always make dolls in the basement, while his daughter(s) were sleeping. Every night, he would take a lock of hair from his oldest daughter’s weave, until she had no more hair, repeat, repeat, repeat. One day, the father came for her last lock of hair. As he saw, she wasn’t there. He was in anger, he ran to his youngest daughter’s room, and she had her back turned facing him, as she was nibbling on cheese silently so her father and sister wouldn’t hear her. He grabbed her and took every lock of her hair and created a new doll that looked just like her, cheese in hand. As she screamed and screamed for her sister, crying, the doll was finished, and her sister was already unconscious. The next morning, her sister came back, looking for her, as she saw her. She ran to give her a big hug, but she then realized, her sister had button eyes, hair, blonde as cheese, and a big smile looking at her.<br><br><br>hehe thanks for reading I tried my best!

You should create a chicken statue and inside it could be the &quot;nursery&quot; for baby chickens and it would be SOOOO cute! Maybe it could be in the middle of the Chicken Town next to the town hall??? Anyways, the &quot;mama chickens&quot; could come in and see the chickens, and when they grow up, they move out. Just an idea! Love you!",2014-11-07T22:08:00Z

KittyKatGaming,"I would love to see more of this i think i can see an emotional side of it trying to come across though, although it was almost drowned by sexual innuendos it&#39;s there and it is gorgeous.",2016-12-08T07:28:43Z
KittyKatGaming,"More, more, very much more! You should definitely keep going. Won&#39;t it be nice to play through a normal-ish seeming girl?",2016-12-02T02:17:41Z
KittyKatGaming,I like these new girls! Please continue playing this game.,2016-12-07T03:24:00Z

KittyKatGaming,id love to see more. especially since A art is awesome. B im really enjoying this series and C these girls actually seem somewhat normal.,2016-12-01T15:28:14Z
KittyKatGaming,"I say if you like it and made it this far, you should keep going with it. (P.S. if this girl isn&#39;t a mermaid, I&#39;m flipping a table 😂)",2016-12-09T04:34:53Z
KittyKatGaming,it&#39;s so strange to hear the girls have... you know.... NORMAL interests in the new house,2016-12-01T15:12:21Z
KittyKatGaming,This series is so fun please keep going,2016-12-01T18:56:07Z

KittyKatGaming,Please continue 💖💖💖☺️☺️☺️,2016-12-02T04:23:54Z
KittyKatGaming,"part of me wants to know if they&#39;re just as fucked up as the previous set of girls, but another part is kinda hoping they&#39;re actually normal and this a reward for sitting through all that weird shit.<br>either way, your commentary for this game is always fun the hear so i wouldn&#39;t mind seeing more of this game from you, suzy!",2016-12-02T01:12:51Z
KittyKatGaming,"I think that each house has a theme. The previous was sexual fetishes. This one is art. I have a suspicion that if you had answered &quot;Not at all&quot; to when Kei had asked if you liked art, she would&#39;ve taken you instead to a house that wasn&#39;t themed around art. Just a suspicion, but you might not get any more dirty pics. I could be wrong though.",2016-12-01T19:17:49Z
KittyKatGaming,It would be awesome if you played more of this. WE COULD POSSIBLY SEE NORMAL CONVERSATIONS!,2017-03-25T15:47:42Z
KittyKatGaming,"Jeez, bad enough to create a &quot;harem&quot; and refer to them as such, but then he just straight up ditches them???<br><br>(I hope you keep playing Suzy!)",2016-12-02T02:30:47Z
KittyKatGaming,Please keep playing these girls actually seem normal.,2016-12-01T17:16:50Z

KittyKatGaming,"Please continue, this game has so much more to give!",2018-01-29T16:41:03Z
KittyKatGaming,Keep going but please take your time exploring the surroundings and talking to other characters. People aren&#39;t saying this because they want you to make certain decisions but because the extra information you get from exploring and talking to other characters reveal other plot points and give you advantages when making in game decisions moving forward. Also it&#39;s to your advantage to make the episodes longer. 30 minutes at least.,2018-01-30T15:12:51Z
KittyKatGaming,keep it going or maybe livestream longer episodes?,2018-01-29T17:57:31Z

KittyKatGaming,"Please continue you two...also this is a game that needs to have everything looked at :) you&#39;d miss how to do certain things otherwise *hint for a subplot coming up*.

KittyKatGaming,"More please! And also if you guys could just take your time to go through things, you might find it interesting :)",2018-02-03T17:28:56Z
KittyKatGaming,this is like when you meet the person of your dreams and right before you ask them out they move away and you never see them again. Hopefully they play this game some more the hype is real!,2018-02-01T13:27:34Z

KittyKatGaming,I&#39;ve liked watching you two using your insight as girls to figure out the correct responses for the game&#39;s girl-to-girl interactions.  I feel like the rest of the people in the Grump house would&#39;ve Russian rouletted those sections.,2018-03-27T18:52:32Z

KittyKatGaming,Suzy i must tell you that you have to collect i think 8 items hidden in the game if you want to beat the game.,2018-05-15T18:09:04Z
KittyKatGaming,Yay! I love these games!,2018-05-15T18:01:16Z
KittyKatGaming,"You gotta get the items along the way, Suzy X3",2018-05-16T15:59:11Z

KittyKatGaming,You got this Suzy!,2018-05-15T18:22:02Z
KittyKatGaming,"That is WAY too long of a sequence to be killed by your mother-in-law.  I could understand one or maybe two chances of losing a life against her as a gag, but not her being this major obstacle.",2018-05-15T19:19:03Z
KittyKatGaming,"Don&#39;t hate yourself for dying, love yourself for making it like 9 screens farther than you did last time you died!",2018-05-17T15:41:55Z

KittyKatGaming,love this look ^_^ like you are playing an old cartoon movie,2018-05-15T18:41:06Z
KittyKatGaming,This game is 10 times harder without the CQC hints on aka arcade settings plus you can do a perfect run like me but if you miss the 1 hidden the treasure the games loops over and over 💀💀 <br><br>good show,2018-09-10T16:23:27Z
KittyKatGaming,"Man, I hope you didn&#39;t miss that blinking key",2018-05-15T18:18:04Z

KittyKatGaming,That&#39;s your mother in law at the beginning,2018-05-15T18:05:51Z
KittyKatGaming,This is REALLY stressful,2018-05-15T23:12:20Z
KittyKatGaming,I was confused at the 3 lives as well,2019-05-23T05:18:22Z
KittyKatGaming,"i don&#39;t know if this game is really hard or i just looking down upon it&#39;s difficulty,<br>i only see 5 possible button the same as guitar heroes series where you only need to press 1 button every few sec.<br><br>missed 1 button for every 40 chain is considered average in guitar heroes.<br>but this game seems far easier but with higher penalty rate for failure.<br>new player might found it&#39;s hard but i believe most people can finish this game sequence at first try.<br>(unless it takes hours to finish this game where people with low concentration will start losing focus)",2018-05-20T11:51:30Z
KittyKatGaming,"wow, in the before time, game makers would spend money to make the games before selling them...today they collect money from you and then sell it to you while spending as little as possible on the actual game....hmhmhmh",2018-05-16T18:01:46Z

KittyKatGaming,im sorry but i really miss the old intro.,2018-05-15T22:26:46Z
